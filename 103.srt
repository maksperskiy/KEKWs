1
00:00:57,561 --> 00:00:59,021
<i>Where to begin?</i>

2
00:01:01,721 --> 00:01:02,941
<i>With water?</i>

3
00:01:05,321 --> 00:01:06,621
<i>Or with fire?</i>

4
00:02:27,321 --> 00:02:29,341
Whoa, boy. Whoa.

5
00:02:46,481 --> 00:02:47,741
Come on, Old Boy.

6
00:03:13,081 --> 00:03:14,981
Want some?

7
00:03:16,081 --> 00:03:17,981
Squirrel, where did you get that?

8
00:03:18,601 --> 00:03:19,821
Found it.

9
00:03:22,361 --> 00:03:24,137
Bit strong.

10
00:03:24,161 --> 00:03:25,417
<i>But not bad.</i>

11
00:03:25,441 --> 00:03:26,701
<i>Witch.</i>

12
00:03:27,001 --> 00:03:28,621
Piss off, half-wit!

13
00:03:29,361 --> 00:03:31,061
Are you heading to the pyre?

14
00:03:31,401 --> 00:03:32,621
I wish I could go.

15
00:03:33,761 --> 00:03:35,461
Gods, I forgot the offering.

16
00:03:35,841 --> 00:03:37,061
Mother will kill me.

17
00:04:22,081 --> 00:04:23,821
<i>Save them.</i>

18
00:04:32,001 --> 00:04:33,777
<i>Save them.</i>

19
00:04:50,561 --> 00:04:54,057
<i>Death is not the end,
Fey Queen.</i>

20
00:04:54,081 --> 00:04:55,301
<i>Seek him.</i>

21
00:04:55,601 --> 00:04:57,461
<i>Death is not the end.</i>

22
00:04:57,641 --> 00:04:59,381
<i>Save them.</i>

23
00:04:59,641 --> 00:05:01,141
I don't understand.

24
00:05:01,561 --> 00:05:02,781
Save who?

25
00:05:04,241 --> 00:05:06,501
<i>No!</i>

26
00:05:07,041 --> 00:05:08,057
What did you do?

27
00:05:08,081 --> 00:05:10,257
<i>What do you think, fool?
Shot supper.</i>

28
00:05:10,281 --> 00:05:13,701
Don't get too close to this witch,
you'll get the worms.

29
00:05:16,761 --> 00:05:18,221
Even her dad left her.

30
00:05:19,081 --> 00:05:21,017
<i>Papa, please!
Papa, don't go! Come back!</i>

31
00:05:21,041 --> 00:05:23,177
Left his own clan
'cause she scared him off.

32
00:05:23,201 --> 00:05:24,617
<i>You are cursed, Nimue.</i>

33
00:05:24,641 --> 00:05:25,861
What did you say?

34
00:05:26,001 --> 00:05:28,261
Don't get brave with me, hag.

35
00:05:30,641 --> 00:05:31,977
Get out of my forest.

36
00:05:32,001 --> 00:05:33,177
I'm not afraid of you...

37
00:05:33,201 --> 00:05:34,617
<i>Get out of my forest!</i>

38
00:05:38,241 --> 00:05:40,021
<i>Get it off me!
Pull it off!</i>

39
00:05:40,201 --> 00:05:42,101
Stop.

40
00:05:42,241 --> 00:05:43,218
Help!

41
00:05:43,242 --> 00:05:44,897
<i>It's in your blood, child.</i>

42
00:05:44,921 --> 00:05:46,017
Let him go!

43
00:05:46,041 --> 00:05:47,937
Let him go!

44
00:05:47,961 --> 00:05:49,257
Quick!

45
00:05:50,441 --> 00:05:51,777
- I got you.
<i>- Nimue.</i>

46
00:05:51,801 --> 00:05:53,021
Stop!

47
00:05:53,641 --> 00:05:54,901
<i>Help!
Nimue!</i>

48
00:05:55,161 --> 00:05:56,377
<i>Nimue.</i>

49
00:05:56,401 --> 00:05:57,657
- Help!
- Let him go.

50
00:05:57,681 --> 00:05:59,897
<i>She brings darkness in the house!
Papa, don't go!</i>

51
00:05:59,921 --> 00:06:00,937
<i>We're cursed.</i>

52
00:06:00,961 --> 00:06:02,181
<i>Benum.</i>

53
00:06:02,321 --> 00:06:03,298
What happened?

54
00:06:03,322 --> 00:06:06,377
<i>She did it! She did it!
She did it!</i>

55
00:06:06,401 --> 00:06:08,021
Cast her out!

56
00:06:11,681 --> 00:06:15,177
- You will string Benum a new bow.
- It wasn't my fault. It just happened.

57
00:06:15,201 --> 00:06:17,337
<i>I'm sorry, Mother.
I couldn't control it.</i>

58
00:06:17,361 --> 00:06:19,857
He will live,
you will make an offering to the family,

59
00:06:19,881 --> 00:06:21,337
I will explain to the Elders.

60
00:06:21,361 --> 00:06:23,657
- I want it to stop. Why won't it stop?
- It will not stop.

61
00:06:23,681 --> 00:06:25,461
No, I hate it!

62
00:06:26,001 --> 00:06:28,221
- It's right what they say about me.
- No.

63
00:06:29,001 --> 00:06:31,101
Never be ashamed of what you are.

64
00:06:31,521 --> 00:06:33,221
They don't call you "demon."

65
00:06:33,521 --> 00:06:34,737
Or "witch."

66
00:06:34,761 --> 00:06:37,261
Did I raise you to suffer fools
or to lead?

67
00:06:37,561 --> 00:06:39,461
Help them understand.

68
00:06:39,881 --> 00:06:43,417
<i>No Sky Folk has ever wielded such power.
Some of us can hear the Hidden...</i>

69
00:06:43,441 --> 00:06:45,417
Are you the High Priestess now
or my mother?

70
00:06:50,241 --> 00:06:52,261
We will discuss this later.

71
00:06:54,041 --> 00:06:55,261
I don't want to go.

72
00:06:58,081 --> 00:07:00,817
You are my daughter and apprentice,

73
00:07:00,841 --> 00:07:03,101
and you will make your offering.

74
00:07:32,521 --> 00:07:33,901
<i>As Summoner,</i>

75
00:07:35,321 --> 00:07:37,261
<i>Agatha communed with the Hidden...</i>

76
00:07:38,801 --> 00:07:40,781
<i>safeguarded our harvest...</i>

77
00:07:41,161 --> 00:07:43,021
<i>and divined the winds.</i>

78
00:07:44,761 --> 00:07:48,741
<i>Let Airimid's Breath push her down
the Great River to the Other World,</i>

79
00:07:48,921 --> 00:07:52,421
<i>where her voice will join
the chorus of our ancestors.</i>

80
00:07:52,881 --> 00:07:55,701
<i>As Sky Folk,
we are born in the dawn...</i>

81
00:07:56,041 --> 00:07:58,701
<i>- to pass in the twilight.
- To pass in the twilight.</i>

82
00:08:24,841 --> 00:08:26,701
The Hidden are with us.

83
00:08:29,081 --> 00:08:31,181
They choose the new Summoner.

84
00:08:51,401 --> 00:08:52,657
Not her. No.

85
00:08:52,681 --> 00:08:53,901
No.

86
00:08:54,001 --> 00:08:55,741
No, not her.

87
00:08:56,641 --> 00:08:59,337
<i>- She is marked by Dark Gods.
- Not her!</i>

88
00:08:59,361 --> 00:09:01,337
<i>- It's witchcraft.
- Sorcery.</i>

89
00:09:01,361 --> 00:09:02,581
How dare you?

90
00:09:03,921 --> 00:09:05,821
The Hidden have chosen.

91
00:09:09,241 --> 00:09:11,701
Nimue is the new Summoner.

92
00:09:13,921 --> 00:09:15,461
I don't want it.

93
00:09:18,281 --> 00:09:20,221
I don't want to be your Summoner!

94
00:09:24,321 --> 00:09:25,541
Nimue.

95
00:09:28,281 --> 00:09:29,541
<i>Nimue!</i>

96
00:09:37,041 --> 00:09:38,261
<i>Nimue.</i>

97
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:42,941
- Nimue!
- Did you enjoy that?

98
00:09:43,841 --> 00:09:46,817
It's not a question of what you want
or what I want.

99
00:09:46,841 --> 00:09:48,661
The will of the Hidden is clear.

100
00:09:49,081 --> 00:09:52,017
The power is a gift and should be used
to guide and serve your kind.

101
00:09:52,041 --> 00:09:53,057
A gift?

102
00:09:53,081 --> 00:09:54,381
It's a curse.

103
00:09:54,561 --> 00:09:56,337
And I don't want to be like you.

104
00:09:56,361 --> 00:09:58,977
And it is very clear
what my kind think of me.

105
00:09:59,001 --> 00:10:00,097
I wonder why.

106
00:10:00,121 --> 00:10:03,021
You do everything in your power
to prove them right.

107
00:10:06,401 --> 00:10:07,621
Nimue.

108
00:10:07,801 --> 00:10:10,141
Well, I relieve you forever
of this burden.

109
00:10:14,121 --> 00:10:15,381
<i>Nimue!</i>

110
00:10:16,641 --> 00:10:18,181
<i>We saw the eclipse.</i>

111
00:10:18,361 --> 00:10:19,457
What's happened?

112
00:10:19,481 --> 00:10:21,141
I'm Summoner.

113
00:10:21,521 --> 00:10:22,498
You're what?

114
00:10:22,522 --> 00:10:24,341
<i>It doesn't matter.
I'm going.</i>

115
00:10:24,561 --> 00:10:27,177
<i>I'm getting on that ship today.
It's still in Hawksbridge.</i>

116
00:10:27,201 --> 00:10:29,257
<i>What? Nimue, slow down,
you're not making any sense.</i>

117
00:10:29,281 --> 00:10:31,177
They don't want me here,
and I don't want them.

118
00:10:31,201 --> 00:10:34,337
- They can all burn in the nine hells.
- Who? What, the Elders?

119
00:10:34,361 --> 00:10:36,741
Who cares
what those shriveled onions think?

120
00:10:36,961 --> 00:10:38,181
Nimue.

121
00:10:41,001 --> 00:10:42,541
You're not really going.

122
00:10:42,841 --> 00:10:43,818
Pym, I have to.

123
00:10:43,842 --> 00:10:45,857
Oh, my gods,
you're acting mad.

124
00:10:45,881 --> 00:10:47,177
I'm riding with you.

125
00:10:58,481 --> 00:10:59,741
<i>God is love.</i>

126
00:11:00,521 --> 00:11:03,141
<i>It is a love that purifies,</i>

127
00:11:03,441 --> 00:11:05,661
<i>sanctifies, and unites us.</i>

128
00:11:06,601 --> 00:11:07,817
<i>And today,</i>

129
00:11:07,841 --> 00:11:09,537
<i>God smiles.</i>

130
00:11:09,561 --> 00:11:10,781
Do you know why?

131
00:11:12,521 --> 00:11:14,701
Because we've done his
work today.

132
00:11:15,761 --> 00:11:16,981
You see,

133
00:11:17,481 --> 00:11:20,221
God created most of us
in his image.

134
00:11:20,881 --> 00:11:23,141
This is his garden,

135
00:11:24,041 --> 00:11:25,861
and we must tend his garden.

136
00:11:27,801 --> 00:11:30,381
We must rake the garden

137
00:11:30,761 --> 00:11:32,301
and pull the weeds.

138
00:11:33,521 --> 00:11:35,461
The weeds are the demons,

139
00:11:36,081 --> 00:11:38,497
and we must expel them
from his garden.

140
00:11:38,521 --> 00:11:39,741
Do you understand?

141
00:11:43,361 --> 00:11:46,421
But the demons wear many faces.

142
00:11:47,241 --> 00:11:48,901
They don't want to be found.

143
00:11:50,281 --> 00:11:52,501
Some of their faces are scary ones.

144
00:11:53,081 --> 00:11:54,381
Some are shy.

145
00:11:55,161 --> 00:11:56,381
And some...

146
00:12:07,521 --> 00:12:09,021
are very young.

147
00:12:15,801 --> 00:12:17,417
We do his work today.

148
00:13:04,641 --> 00:13:05,861
Lenore!

149
00:13:07,121 --> 00:13:08,381
It's a Moon Wing.

150
00:13:18,481 --> 00:13:21,581
They came by day as we slept.

151
00:13:21,961 --> 00:13:23,901
The men in red robes.

152
00:13:26,481 --> 00:13:28,501
They burned our trees.

153
00:13:28,881 --> 00:13:32,821
The smoke killed many in their sleep.

154
00:13:35,201 --> 00:13:37,581
Others burned...

155
00:13:38,121 --> 00:13:39,421
or fell.

156
00:13:41,241 --> 00:13:45,217
<i>The rest fell
to the steel of the Gray Monk.</i>

157
00:14:21,241 --> 00:14:24,181
The one who cries.

158
00:14:25,161 --> 00:14:28,617
<i>The Red Paladins are moving north.
And we're right in their path.</i>

159
00:14:28,641 --> 00:14:31,577
<i>We need to send scouts
to get a sense of their numbers.</i>

160
00:14:31,601 --> 00:14:34,377
<i>Will the king do nothing
about this slaughter?</i>

161
00:14:34,401 --> 00:14:36,061
<i>We are on our own.</i>

162
00:14:36,201 --> 00:14:38,901
<i>No friends of the Fey
serve Uther Pendragon.</i>

163
00:14:53,521 --> 00:14:54,741
Yeah.

164
00:14:56,761 --> 00:14:58,181
I hate wizards.

165
00:14:58,521 --> 00:15:01,861
If he so much as points a finger at me,
you stick him, Hook.

166
00:15:08,121 --> 00:15:09,781
Merlin the Magician?

167
00:15:09,921 --> 00:15:13,661
You owe Lord Gray River
4,000 gold coin.

168
00:15:20,801 --> 00:15:23,461
<i>Oi!</i>

169
00:15:25,921 --> 00:15:27,221
Bloody hell.

170
00:15:28,481 --> 00:15:29,941
Search his robes.

171
00:15:36,241 --> 00:15:40,861
A Carpathian king once sent 400 assassins
to claim my head.

172
00:15:41,641 --> 00:15:42,641
Dacians.

173
00:15:43,801 --> 00:15:49,141
I burned them all in a lightning storm
that lasted seven whole days.

174
00:15:51,921 --> 00:15:57,821
Tell Lord Gray River
I'm insulted by this paltry show of force.

175
00:15:58,481 --> 00:16:01,857
Or better yet,
I'll send you back as mole rats...

176
00:16:01,881 --> 00:16:04,577
to convey my displeasure?

177
00:16:06,081 --> 00:16:07,981
The spell is quite simple.

178
00:16:08,641 --> 00:16:10,337
Chiggur...

179
00:16:10,361 --> 00:16:12,217
<i>No, no, no, no.
No. It...</i>

180
00:16:12,241 --> 00:16:15,861
There's no call for that type of thing,
Lord Merlin. But just...

181
00:16:16,721 --> 00:16:17,941
Hook.

182
00:16:20,601 --> 00:16:21,821
We're just...

183
00:16:22,121 --> 00:16:23,341
Let's go.

184
00:16:40,961 --> 00:16:44,021
But you didn't turn them into mole rats,
did you, Merlin?

185
00:16:45,281 --> 00:16:47,261
Maybe the rumors are true, then.

186
00:16:47,961 --> 00:16:50,621
Maybe you really have
lost your magic.

187
00:17:01,041 --> 00:17:02,537
At least two dozen Fey villages

188
00:17:02,561 --> 00:17:06,181
have burned at the torch of Father Carden
and the Red Paladins, Your Majesty.

189
00:17:06,361 --> 00:17:09,341
This Carden has his bloody nerve.

190
00:17:09,521 --> 00:17:12,541
Not only nerve,
but popular support.

191
00:17:13,761 --> 00:17:16,141
Given the months of drought and famine,

192
00:17:16,281 --> 00:17:20,861
the peasantry now assign most of the blame
for their miseries to Fey witchcraft.

193
00:17:21,081 --> 00:17:22,581
"Most of the blame"?

194
00:17:23,041 --> 00:17:24,657
Well, the rest blame you, sire.

195
00:17:24,681 --> 00:17:25,981
For the drought?

196
00:17:26,361 --> 00:17:27,737
They blame us?

197
00:17:32,441 --> 00:17:33,661
Merlin.

198
00:17:34,201 --> 00:17:35,621
Perfect timing.

199
00:17:37,161 --> 00:17:39,061
That is debatable,
Your Majesty.

200
00:17:39,681 --> 00:17:43,257
We found him in the cabbages,
sire. Drunk, I'm afraid.

201
00:17:43,281 --> 00:17:44,501
Shocking.

202
00:17:44,761 --> 00:17:47,141
You promised us rain, Merlin.

203
00:17:47,481 --> 00:17:51,621
You promise many things,
and they never seem to happen.

204
00:17:51,961 --> 00:17:53,457
Weather is fickle, my liege.

205
00:17:53,481 --> 00:17:55,377
A classic Merlin answer.

206
00:17:55,401 --> 00:17:59,501
You see, Borley,
Merlin is a conflicted creature.

207
00:17:59,681 --> 00:18:02,137
These are his kind being
put to the torch.

208
00:18:02,161 --> 00:18:03,381
Yet...

209
00:18:04,001 --> 00:18:06,897
<i>he seems rather unmoved.</i>

210
00:18:06,921 --> 00:18:09,821
Well, the Fey Kind are, quite frankly,
better farmers.

211
00:18:10,001 --> 00:18:12,781
So, in times of want,

212
00:18:13,281 --> 00:18:15,781
the mob finds reason to
steal their food.

213
00:18:16,201 --> 00:18:21,297
Father Carden and his paladins
are dull vessels for these old hatreds,

214
00:18:21,321 --> 00:18:22,541
and nothing more.

215
00:18:23,161 --> 00:18:26,097
However,
if His Majesty would allow it,

216
00:18:26,121 --> 00:18:29,181
the Shadow Lords may be able
to offer some service here.

217
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:31,021
Shadow Lords?

218
00:18:31,561 --> 00:18:34,297
It's a bit late for your enchanters
to help us now.

219
00:18:34,321 --> 00:18:35,821
Not necessarily.

220
00:18:36,121 --> 00:18:38,981
They can pull certain strings
to slow Carden's march.

221
00:18:39,481 --> 00:18:41,537
There are Shadow Lords
at every level of socie...

222
00:18:41,561 --> 00:18:43,901
We want rain, Merlin!

223
00:18:46,841 --> 00:18:48,617
To hell with your Shadow Lords.

224
00:18:48,641 --> 00:18:51,097
I will redouble my efforts,
Your Majesty.

225
00:18:51,121 --> 00:18:52,861
Yes, do.

226
00:20:26,881 --> 00:20:30,497
<i>I can't believe you dragged me here.
I've got lye smell all over me.</i>

227
00:20:30,521 --> 00:20:33,457
<i>No one asked you to come.
Well, you don't know what you're doing.</i>

228
00:20:33,481 --> 00:20:37,097
<i>I do know.
Gawain took the Brass Shield,</i>

229
00:20:37,121 --> 00:20:39,377
the only ship that crosses the sea
to the desert kingdoms.

230
00:20:39,401 --> 00:20:41,377
Because nobody wants to go
to the desert kingdoms,

231
00:20:41,401 --> 00:20:44,461
- which should tell you something.
- I'm getting on it.

232
00:20:45,601 --> 00:20:47,537
Nimue, the Hidden chose you.

233
00:20:47,561 --> 00:20:50,217
<i>We all saw the eclipse.
That means you're Summoner.</i>

234
00:20:50,241 --> 00:20:52,941
And it makes sense,
with what you can do.

235
00:20:53,081 --> 00:20:54,821
You sound like Mother.

236
00:20:55,361 --> 00:20:58,857
<i>At least your mother wants you home.
Mine wants me out.</i>

237
00:20:58,881 --> 00:21:02,581
<i>And this will be her excuse. She'll say,</i>
"Nimue's gone, get on with it."

238
00:21:02,841 --> 00:21:06,577
<i>- She'll marry me off to the fishmonger.
- Stinky Aaron.</i>

239
00:21:06,601 --> 00:21:08,057
It's not funny.

240
00:21:08,081 --> 00:21:09,861
It's kind of funny.

241
00:21:10,281 --> 00:21:11,977
What if they find out you're a girl?

242
00:21:12,001 --> 00:21:13,617
I'm cutting my hair.

243
00:21:13,641 --> 00:21:15,377
But what if they find out
you're Fey Kind?

244
00:21:15,401 --> 00:21:16,621
They won't.

245
00:21:16,961 --> 00:21:18,541
You'll look after Old Boy?

246
00:21:18,801 --> 00:21:20,301
No, I'll let him starve.

247
00:21:21,201 --> 00:21:22,581
What about money?

248
00:21:22,881 --> 00:21:24,857
- I have 20 silver.
- Well, what if they rob you?

249
00:21:24,881 --> 00:21:26,101
Pym!

250
00:21:33,961 --> 00:21:35,981
Look,
I don't even see the ship.

251
00:21:36,721 --> 00:21:38,901
- All right? You've made your point.
- No.

252
00:21:39,481 --> 00:21:41,061
It was supposed to be here.

253
00:21:49,441 --> 00:21:50,497
Stop it.

254
00:21:50,521 --> 00:21:52,141
Stop. Stop it.

255
00:21:52,201 --> 00:21:53,421
Excuse me, sir.

256
00:21:54,441 --> 00:21:57,257
- When is the Brass Shield due to arrive?
- She's not going.

257
00:21:57,281 --> 00:21:59,061
Brass Shield left yesterday.

258
00:21:59,441 --> 00:22:03,177
<i>But it... It's not supposed to leave
for another week.</i>

259
00:22:03,201 --> 00:22:04,901
Tell that to the easterly winds.

260
00:22:05,841 --> 00:22:07,097
Well, when does it return?

261
00:22:07,121 --> 00:22:08,341
Six months.

262
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:10,421
Now, do you mind?

263
00:22:11,161 --> 00:22:12,377
Oi!

264
00:22:12,401 --> 00:22:13,781
Those can't stay there.

265
00:22:13,961 --> 00:22:16,301
You guys are not shifting this
fast enough.

266
00:22:26,081 --> 00:22:28,781
At least I get to keep you
a bit longer.

267
00:22:28,881 --> 00:22:30,101
Hmm?

268
00:22:32,321 --> 00:22:33,621
Six months.

269
00:22:36,041 --> 00:22:37,137
I know.

270
00:22:37,161 --> 00:22:39,861
I'll be Summoner,
and you marry Stinky Aaron.

271
00:22:41,321 --> 00:22:42,541
Hmm?

272
00:22:42,961 --> 00:22:46,261
Come on,
your life's not so horrible.

273
00:22:46,801 --> 00:22:48,181
Come on.

274
00:22:48,761 --> 00:22:50,021
Come on.

275
00:23:02,041 --> 00:23:04,701
Out from in there,
you little tyke!

276
00:23:08,761 --> 00:23:12,901
<i>Would you like to buy some of my pies?
Fresh. Just made this very morning.</i>

277
00:23:13,241 --> 00:23:14,701
Sorry!

278
00:23:14,961 --> 00:23:16,181
I'm hungry.

279
00:23:16,641 --> 00:23:18,341
Oh, sheep.

280
00:23:23,001 --> 00:23:24,937
Look. Isn't that amazing?

281
00:23:24,961 --> 00:23:26,261
Wow. Look there.

282
00:23:35,081 --> 00:23:36,301
Ooh, look.

283
00:23:37,681 --> 00:23:39,061
This is your color.

284
00:23:40,481 --> 00:23:43,541
<i>What do you think about this? I like this.
That doesn't work.</i>

285
00:23:49,401 --> 00:23:50,821
Come on, Nimue.

286
00:23:51,561 --> 00:23:52,781
There's music.

287
00:23:55,241 --> 00:23:57,657
<i>♪ With meadows green and skies a-blue ♪</i>

288
00:23:57,681 --> 00:24:00,581

<i>♪ Sing high-lolly-li-summer-hi-lolly-lo ♪</i>

00:24:16,681 --> 00:24:20,257

299
00:24:54,681 --> 00:24:56,737
He fancies you.

300
00:24:56,761 --> 00:24:57,981
Stop it.

301
00:25:02,881 --> 00:25:04,221
Look at that!

302
00:25:05,561 --> 00:25:07,381
You dropped this, milady.

303
00:25:08,841 --> 00:25:10,581
Do I look like a juggler to you?

304
00:25:11,361 --> 00:25:12,981
Not quite yet, no.

305
00:25:16,161 --> 00:25:18,661
<i>Perfect.</i>

306
00:25:20,681 --> 00:25:22,181
I only juggle fire.

307
00:25:22,881 --> 00:25:24,101
Oh, I believe that.

308
00:25:25,201 --> 00:25:26,297
Fancy an ale?

309
00:25:26,321 --> 00:25:28,181
We don't drink with strange men.

310
00:25:28,281 --> 00:25:29,541
What's your name?

311
00:25:32,921 --> 00:25:34,141
I'm Nimue.

312
00:25:34,801 --> 00:25:36,621
- This is Pym.
- Hello.

313
00:25:38,441 --> 00:25:40,981
Well, now we're not strangers.

314
00:25:42,161 --> 00:25:43,381
I'm Arthur.

315
00:25:50,481 --> 00:25:51,458
It's late.

316
00:25:51,482 --> 00:25:54,141
<i>We should go. As it is,
we'll be riding in the dark. Come on.</i>

317
00:25:54,441 --> 00:25:56,617
Then no point worrying about it,
is there?

318
00:25:56,641 --> 00:25:57,861
So...

319
00:25:57,921 --> 00:26:00,621
<i>you're not from Hawksbridge.
Where are you from?</i>

320
00:26:01,361 --> 00:26:02,577
Near enough.

321
00:26:02,601 --> 00:26:03,821
And you?

322
00:26:04,561 --> 00:26:07,257
We both know
you're not a professional singer.

323
00:26:07,281 --> 00:26:08,258
That hurts.

324
00:26:08,282 --> 00:26:09,777
Are you a sword for hire?

325
00:26:09,801 --> 00:26:11,261
A knight, milady.

326
00:26:13,321 --> 00:26:15,061
What? You don't believe me?

327
00:26:18,041 --> 00:26:22,177
Uh, you just seem a bit young and scruffy
for a knight.

328
00:26:22,201 --> 00:26:26,421
Lads, Arthur's found himself
some nice country girls.

329
00:26:29,201 --> 00:26:30,701
Look at that fine skin.

330
00:26:32,001 --> 00:26:33,617
- Do you girls dance?
- Carry on.

331
00:26:33,641 --> 00:26:34,861
Ah-ah-ah!

332
00:26:35,521 --> 00:26:36,781
May I have a go?

333
00:26:37,401 --> 00:26:39,461
- No. Bad idea.
- What are you doing?

334
00:26:40,641 --> 00:26:42,497
But of course, milady.

335
00:26:42,521 --> 00:26:43,981
You got five silver?

336
00:26:44,521 --> 00:26:46,061
I don't, I'm afraid.

337
00:26:48,721 --> 00:26:49,941
Well...

338
00:26:50,561 --> 00:26:52,461
we allow different wagers.

339
00:26:54,921 --> 00:26:58,541
- How about we roll for a kiss?
- Oh, we were just leaving, actually.

340
00:26:58,721 --> 00:26:59,981
<i>Fine.</i>

341
00:27:02,441 --> 00:27:05,377
But if I win,
I get ten silver.

342
00:27:05,401 --> 00:27:08,261
- You can't win. The dice are weighted.
- Shut your mouth.

343
00:27:09,281 --> 00:27:11,221
Ten? To me...

344
00:27:12,201 --> 00:27:13,861
high price indeed.

345
00:27:15,841 --> 00:27:20,061
<i>Just roll seven in any combination.
Three and four, five and two. See?</i>

346
00:27:20,281 --> 00:27:22,021
The odds favor you.

347
00:27:22,561 --> 00:27:24,741
I've just had a rush of dumb luck.

348
00:27:59,481 --> 00:28:00,701
Roll them again.

349
00:28:01,201 --> 00:28:02,257
Why? I won.

350
00:28:02,281 --> 00:28:04,261
<i>Best two out of three.
Seems fair.</i>

351
00:28:04,441 --> 00:28:07,341
<i>Those weren't the rules.
Roll again. Don't be daft.</i>

352
00:28:08,321 --> 00:28:09,857
Then it's 20 silver if I win.

353
00:28:11,521 --> 00:28:13,901
Can you believe this little maid, eh?

354
00:28:14,321 --> 00:28:17,181
You want 20 silver?

355
00:28:18,441 --> 00:28:21,381
Then I want my money's worth as well.

356
00:28:23,201 --> 00:28:25,141
- Deal.
- Nimue, enough.

357
00:28:54,441 --> 00:28:56,101
You witching me?

358
00:28:56,561 --> 00:28:57,781
Why?

359
00:28:58,561 --> 00:29:00,301
Are you afraid of witches?

360
00:29:03,921 --> 00:29:06,341
<i>Nimue, come on!</i>

361
00:29:08,241 --> 00:29:09,981
Who the hell is she?

362
00:29:10,361 --> 00:29:11,581
Witch!

363
00:29:11,921 --> 00:29:13,461
Stop the witch!

364
00:29:14,401 --> 00:29:16,101
Oops, sorry!

365
00:29:17,961 --> 00:29:19,581
You! You! Girls!

366
00:29:20,801 --> 00:29:22,341
- Oi, stop!
- Witches!

367
00:29:22,681 --> 00:29:24,937
- I said, stop!
- Out of the way!

368
00:29:27,601 --> 00:29:29,341
Dellum the Physician?

369
00:29:29,641 --> 00:29:30,901
Who's asking?

370
00:29:32,001 --> 00:29:34,217
I've heard you're a collector of sorts.

371
00:29:34,241 --> 00:29:35,697
No, you misheard.

372
00:29:35,721 --> 00:29:39,297
I was told to stop doing that,
so everything here is quite above board.

373
00:29:39,321 --> 00:29:41,301
- Sanctioned and all that.
- Pity.

374
00:29:42,001 --> 00:29:44,017
See, I was willing to pay handsomely

375
00:29:44,041 --> 00:29:48,101
for a chance to see
your even more obscure items.

376
00:29:49,721 --> 00:29:52,177
Well, is there anything in particular
you're looking for?

377
00:29:52,201 --> 00:29:54,461
I'm looking for the number three.

378
00:29:55,201 --> 00:29:58,737
<i>You're him, ain't you?
There's mad rumors you work for the king.</i>

379
00:29:58,761 --> 00:30:00,141
- You're Merlin...
- Shh!

380
00:30:00,681 --> 00:30:03,981
Bad things happen
to those who speak my name aloud.

381
00:30:06,921 --> 00:30:10,021
- Do you have what I'm looking for?
- The number three, yes.

382
00:30:10,121 --> 00:30:13,021
I acquired it three days ago,
as a matter of fact.

383
00:30:14,921 --> 00:30:16,941
Born to a peasant family in Shorne.

384
00:30:18,121 --> 00:30:19,621
Don't mind the smell.

385
00:30:21,881 --> 00:30:23,261
Oh, allow me.

386
00:30:34,921 --> 00:30:36,141
That'll do.

387
00:30:37,561 --> 00:30:41,217
Uh, m-might I inquire
as to the interest in this item?

388
00:30:41,241 --> 00:30:45,737
Three faces, nine doves, 31 magpies,

389
00:30:45,761 --> 00:30:48,057
three-one-one-three, 13.

390
00:30:48,081 --> 00:30:49,661
Magical child.

391
00:30:50,481 --> 00:30:53,861
A new dawn and
a great and terrible war.

392
00:30:59,161 --> 00:31:00,581
Thanks...

393
00:31:00,681 --> 00:31:01,901
No.

394
00:31:05,921 --> 00:31:07,697
<i>Who are they?
I don't know.</i>

395
00:31:07,721 --> 00:31:08,977
We have to go faster.

396
00:31:19,241 --> 00:31:20,461
What are you doing?

397
00:31:20,721 --> 00:31:22,061
We can't outrun them.

398
00:31:44,921 --> 00:31:46,501
Shh.

399
00:32:06,281 --> 00:32:08,101
Shh shh-shh shh.

400
00:32:12,721 --> 00:32:14,701
- There.
- Right.

401
00:32:15,161 --> 00:32:16,697
Ya! Go on!

402
00:32:22,761 --> 00:32:24,621
By the way,
you dropped this.

403
00:32:27,161 --> 00:32:29,617
You came all this way
just to return a cloak?

404
00:32:29,641 --> 00:32:32,821
<i>And to see you got home safely.
Sorry about the tavern.</i>

405
00:32:33,841 --> 00:32:35,657
You mean your friends, the knights?

406
00:32:35,681 --> 00:32:38,421
- I'm not like Bors.
- What, you're not a mercenary?

407
00:32:39,121 --> 00:32:41,577
I think what she means to say,

408
00:32:41,601 --> 00:32:44,337
though she's clearly mentally incapable
at the moment,

409
00:32:44,361 --> 00:32:47,501
is, "Thank you,
that's very nice of you."

410
00:32:47,921 --> 00:32:49,501
You're Fey, aren't you?

411
00:32:50,041 --> 00:32:51,697
I haven't met your kind before.

412
00:32:51,721 --> 00:32:53,137
You don't seem so scary.

413
00:32:53,161 --> 00:32:55,337
Well, that's because
you don't know us very well.

414
00:32:55,361 --> 00:32:57,897
- Witching men in broad daylight.
- We're not witches.

415
00:32:57,921 --> 00:33:00,701
Bors is one thing,
Red Paladins are quite another.

416
00:33:01,001 --> 00:33:03,177
They're burning Fey villages
along the Beggar's Coast.

417
00:33:03,201 --> 00:33:04,781
So, you need to be careful.

418
00:33:07,841 --> 00:33:09,341
Hey, where are you going?

419
00:33:09,441 --> 00:33:10,661
Making camp.

420
00:33:11,281 --> 00:33:14,941
<i>There's a lot of paladins on the road.
I've got fire and good wine.</i>

421
00:33:16,041 --> 00:33:19,061
Well, the wine's awful,
but the company's good.

422
00:33:21,041 --> 00:33:22,261
Any objections?

423
00:33:38,641 --> 00:33:39,697
What are you doing?

424
00:33:39,721 --> 00:33:41,701
Stalking.

425
00:33:44,121 --> 00:33:45,821
Have you held a sword before?

426
00:33:46,121 --> 00:33:47,501
I've killed hundreds.

427
00:33:48,881 --> 00:33:50,381
I think I can get closer.

428
00:33:57,201 --> 00:33:58,701
Be careful.

429
00:33:59,561 --> 00:34:01,861
- To the death, is it?
- If you're careless.

430
00:34:07,081 --> 00:34:10,381
<i>You're just using the blade.
That's a waste of a good sword.</i>

431
00:34:11,561 --> 00:34:13,101
You talk too much.

432
00:34:16,441 --> 00:34:18,781
A sword is more than a blade.

433
00:34:19,521 --> 00:34:21,181
It's the cross guard.

434
00:34:21,441 --> 00:34:22,781
It's the pommel.

435
00:34:23,481 --> 00:34:24,737
<i>Legs.</i>

436
00:34:24,761 --> 00:34:26,621
<i>Body weight.</i>

437
00:34:43,841 --> 00:34:46,341
- Head.
- Tavern brawler, eh?

438
00:34:48,081 --> 00:34:49,301
Yah!

439
00:34:51,241 --> 00:34:52,501
Ow.

440
00:34:54,161 --> 00:34:55,737
Yield.

441
00:34:55,761 --> 00:34:56,981
You cheated.

442
00:34:59,441 --> 00:35:00,661
Did I hurt you?

443
00:35:02,801 --> 00:35:04,341
You've lowered your guard.

444
00:35:05,601 --> 00:35:07,181
Your sword is in the grass.

445
00:35:07,961 --> 00:35:10,141
- I won.
- Have you?

446
00:35:13,681 --> 00:35:14,981
Is that a cheese knife?

447
00:35:17,121 --> 00:35:18,937
- Yield.
- To you?

448
00:35:18,961 --> 00:35:20,181
Gladly.

449
00:35:40,801 --> 00:35:42,377
Nimue!

450
00:37:32,201 --> 00:37:33,421
Pym.

451
00:37:33,921 --> 00:37:35,221
Pym, we have to go.

452
00:37:42,721 --> 00:37:44,501
<i>- My head.</i>
- Shh. Shh!

453
00:37:45,521 --> 00:37:46,781
It's the wine.

454
00:37:49,321 --> 00:37:50,541
Come on.

455
00:37:52,001 --> 00:37:53,701
Hey. Don't wake him.

456
00:37:59,041 --> 00:38:01,817
<i>Go on then. Tell me what happened.
No. Nothing.</i>

457
00:38:01,841 --> 00:38:05,457
<i>Oh, come on.
Did you kiss him? Did he kiss you?</i>

458
00:38:05,481 --> 00:38:06,458
No.

459
00:38:06,482 --> 00:38:08,177
<i>Why not?
He's gorgeous.</i>

460
00:38:08,201 --> 00:38:11,577
<i>Can we just not talk about this?
No, we're definitely talking about it.</i>

461
00:38:11,601 --> 00:38:13,217
Does he have onion breath
or something?

462
00:38:13,241 --> 00:38:14,581
No, I had a vision.

463
00:38:14,841 --> 00:38:16,061
All right?

464
00:38:16,721 --> 00:38:18,617
<i>Was it the real deal?</i>

465
00:38:18,641 --> 00:38:20,577
Your eyes rolled back and everything?

466
00:38:20,601 --> 00:38:21,861
I don't know.

467
00:38:24,521 --> 00:38:27,021
Gods, we've been gone
for nearly two days.

468
00:38:34,201 --> 00:38:35,337
Nimue.

469
00:38:59,201 --> 00:39:00,421
Mother.

470
00:39:03,241 --> 00:39:05,061
- Mother!
- Nimue, no!

471
00:39:29,841 --> 00:39:31,861
- Pym!
- Nimue!

472
00:39:32,641 --> 00:39:34,137
- Nimue! Help me!
- Pym.

473
00:39:34,161 --> 00:39:35,577
Help me! No!

474
00:39:35,601 --> 00:39:36,821
Pym!

475
00:39:37,281 --> 00:39:38,258
No!

476
00:39:38,282 --> 00:39:39,701
- Come here.
- No!

477
00:39:40,081 --> 00:39:41,901
No!

478
00:40:14,841 --> 00:40:17,101
No.

479
00:41:48,721 --> 00:41:49,941
Come with me.

480
00:41:52,761 --> 00:41:53,981
In here.

481
00:41:56,721 --> 00:41:57,941
Are you hurt?

482
00:41:58,401 --> 00:41:59,457
I can't find Papa.

483
00:41:59,481 --> 00:42:00,777
Squirrel, listen to me.

484
00:42:00,801 --> 00:42:02,817
Go to the Iron Wood
and hide in the Old Man Rock.

485
00:42:02,841 --> 00:42:05,181
<i>Do you understand?
Hey, are you listening?</i>

486
00:42:05,601 --> 00:42:08,981
<i>Run like you do in our fox races.
No one can ever catch you.</i>

487
00:42:09,201 --> 00:42:10,421
You'll come for me?

488
00:42:11,001 --> 00:42:12,857
Yeah, I will. I will.

489
00:42:12,881 --> 00:42:14,737
I need to find Pym and Mother first.

490
00:42:14,761 --> 00:42:16,821
I saw your mother near the temple.

491
00:42:17,041 --> 00:42:18,461
They were chasing her.

492
00:42:20,441 --> 00:42:22,061
You'll be faster without it.

493
00:42:23,281 --> 00:42:24,501
Fast as the fox.

494
00:42:24,681 --> 00:42:25,901
Fast as the fox.

495
00:42:26,441 --> 00:42:27,781
Go.

496
00:43:05,921 --> 00:43:07,701
See this, brothers?

497
00:43:11,441 --> 00:43:13,621
This is why we must be strong.

498
00:43:19,361 --> 00:43:21,061
He will take forms...

499
00:43:22,281 --> 00:43:23,981
that will tear our hearts.

500
00:43:25,001 --> 00:43:26,221
Look at her.

501
00:43:29,721 --> 00:43:30,941
Such eyes.

502
00:43:33,681 --> 00:43:35,781
Yet infected just the same.

503
00:43:36,361 --> 00:43:38,541
We should give thanks, my brothers,

504
00:43:39,041 --> 00:43:44,781
for this opportunity to show our resolve
in the face of such treachery.

505
00:43:47,761 --> 00:43:49,461
Now give her to the fire.

506
00:43:50,041 --> 00:43:51,421
Reveal its true form.

507
00:43:51,761 --> 00:43:53,261
No... no!

508
00:43:53,441 --> 00:43:54,821
<i>No.</i>

509
00:43:56,841 --> 00:43:58,341
Fey archers to the north!

510
00:44:00,801 --> 00:44:02,021
Stop!

511
00:44:02,281 --> 00:44:03,781
You! After her!

512
00:44:15,641 --> 00:44:16,981
Mother?

513
00:44:24,241 --> 00:44:25,461
Mother?

514
00:44:37,561 --> 00:44:38,941
Mother?

515
00:44:40,241 --> 00:44:41,461
- No.
- Nimue.

516
00:44:44,441 --> 00:44:46,541
- I'm sorry.
<i>- Nimue, listen.</i>

517
00:44:46,801 --> 00:44:48,457
- I shouldn't have gone.
- Nimue.

518
00:44:48,481 --> 00:44:50,021
I shouldn't have gone!

519
00:44:50,361 --> 00:44:52,777
- I... No, don't.
- Listen to me.

520
00:44:55,041 --> 00:44:56,421
Listen to me.

521
00:44:59,081 --> 00:45:00,421
There is something...

522
00:45:06,321 --> 00:45:08,261
There is something you must do.

523
00:45:10,761 --> 00:45:12,817
Take this to Merlin.

524
00:45:12,841 --> 00:45:14,657
<i>But we have to run.
We have to run.</i>

525
00:45:14,681 --> 00:45:17,101
No. This is your charge.

526
00:45:17,641 --> 00:45:19,341
It's all that matters now.

527
00:45:20,121 --> 00:45:22,221
Bring this to Merlin.

528
00:45:33,721 --> 00:45:35,337
Run, Nimue.

529
00:45:35,361 --> 00:45:37,177
- No...
- Run.

530
00:45:37,201 --> 00:45:39,541
<i>No. No,
I won't leave you. No!</i>

531
00:45:40,081 --> 00:45:42,817
- No!
- I love you more than anything.

532
00:45:42,841 --> 00:45:43,841
Mother.

533
00:45:49,841 --> 00:45:51,861
<i>No!</i>

534
00:45:54,281 --> 00:45:55,501
Go!

535
00:45:55,841 --> 00:45:57,061
Run!

536
00:46:05,121 --> 00:46:06,381
Hold the rod.

537
00:46:06,601 --> 00:46:08,937
<i>Are we...
are we sure it's safe up here, sir?</i>

538
00:46:08,961 --> 00:46:10,221
Take it outside.

539
00:46:10,561 --> 00:46:11,577
Outside?

540
00:46:11,601 --> 00:46:13,741
<i>Outside!
Is that a good idea?</i>

541
00:46:15,841 --> 00:46:17,061
Hold it up!

542
00:46:18,481 --> 00:46:20,021
Aim it at the clouds!

543
00:46:23,681 --> 00:46:24,981
Feet on the metal!

544
00:46:25,481 --> 00:46:27,941
Why? What's gonna happen?

545
00:46:30,521 --> 00:46:31,741
This is madness!

546
00:46:35,601 --> 00:46:37,581
- Wait.
- No, please.

547
00:46:43,921 --> 00:46:45,421
Oh, gods.

548
00:47:10,041 --> 00:47:13,021
<i>The heavens have opened, my friends.
Rejoice!</i>

549
00:47:13,241 --> 00:47:16,097
The drought is ended.

550
00:47:16,121 --> 00:47:17,581
- To the king!
- Uther!

551
00:47:17,921 --> 00:47:20,741
We do not drink to the rain.

552
00:47:20,921 --> 00:47:22,457
We drink it.

553
00:47:22,481 --> 00:47:25,701
<i>- Hail...
- Hail Uther!</i>

554
00:47:31,721 --> 00:47:32,941
What?

555
00:47:36,121 --> 00:47:37,341
What is this?

556
00:47:40,241 --> 00:47:41,501
What trick is this?

557
00:47:45,041 --> 00:47:47,461
That is the rain
that fell upon the castle.

558
00:47:49,161 --> 00:47:50,381
Merlin.

559
00:47:52,121 --> 00:47:53,581
Merlin!

560
00:48:46,041 --> 00:48:47,821
No!

561
00:50:11,961 --> 00:50:13,297
<i>Fight, Nimue.</i>
