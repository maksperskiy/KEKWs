1
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:03,829
<i>My name is Barry Allen,</i>

2
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:05,434
<i>and I am
the fastest man alive.</i>

3
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:07,200
<i>To the outside world,</i>

4
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:09,192
<i>I'm an ordinary
forensic scientist.</i>

5
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:10,595
<i>But secretly, with the help</i>

6
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:12,319
<i>of my friends
at S.T.A.R. Labs,</i>

7
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:13,960
<i>I fight crime
and find other meta-humans</i>

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,150
<i>like me.</i>

9
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:17,136
<i>But when my daughter came back
from the future to help,</i>

10
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:19,880
<i>she changed the present</i>

11
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:22,475
<i>and now our world is
more dangerous than ever.</i>

12
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,870
<i>And I'm the only one
fast enough to save it.</i>

13
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,435
<i>I am the Flash.</i>

14
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:29,536
<i>Previously on</i> The Flash...

15
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:31,597
<i>Meet Joss Jackam.</i>

16
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:34,195
<i>She's a delinquent teen
turned amateur storm chaser.</i>

17
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:36,556
<i>That weathervane,
doesn't it look a lot like...</i>

18
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:38,240
<i>The staff
she was carrying, yeah.</i>

19
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:41,159
<i>It's infected
with a satellite shard.</i>

20
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:43,311
Our satellite didn't
just create new metas.

21
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:44,400
It created meta-tech.

22
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:47,872
Every time you vibe
or breach,

23
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:49,256
the dark matter
is going to affect

24
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,656
your central nervous system,
causing you

25
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:52,034
<i>more and more pain.</i>

26
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:53,918
- We need to talk.
<i>- Yes, Nora.</i>

27
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,514
Yes, we do.

28
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:02,631
You've been gone
a long time, Nora.

29
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:04,518
You're lucky
I came back at all.

30
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:05,600
Really?

31
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,872
I can tell you have questions.

32
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:15,834
Ask them.

33
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,957
- You killed my grandmother?
- I did.

34
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:19,554
- In front of my father?
- I did.

35
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:20,680
- He was a boy.
- Nora...

36
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:23,036
He was just a kid!

37
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,315
You're right,

38
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:28,076
and I think of
that moment every day,

39
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:30,595
how it changed
the course of destiny

40
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:31,955
for him,

41
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,554
<i>for you,</i>

42
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:34,915
for me.

43
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,799
I never knew he had that kind
of hatred inside of him,

44
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:40,349
but he does because of you.

45
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:43,558
And I have that same hatred
inside of me for him!

46
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,478
Or at least I did.

47
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:50,951
I was inspired by him,
as you are.

48
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,635
I wanted to know him,
as you do.

49
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:57,191
I wanted to be him.
I wanted to be the Flash.

50
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,920
You will never be the Flash.

51
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,150
Exactly!

52
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:05,719
And that realization
is what broke me.

53
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:09,232
<i>That's the realization
that led me to do</i>

54
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,720
<i>the things that I did.</i>

55
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,918
The terrible, horrible,

56
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,311
evil things I did.

57
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:20,154
I've been coming here
for so long.

58
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,959
Why didn't you tell me
what you did?

59
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,520
I thought you must know.

60
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,159
Your mother would've told you.

61
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,352
I was wrong. I see that.

62
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:31,751
I'm sorry, Nora.

63
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:33,712
I don't trust you anymore.

64
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,957
Have I not
given you everything?

65
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:39,114
<i>The chance to go back and know
a father you never knew?</i>

66
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,396
<i>To learn from him?
To run with him?</i>

67
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:43,278
To run with the Flash.

68
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:47,149
I showed you how
to time travel because...

69
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,833
I want to help you.

70
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,435
No, the only person that you
ever help is yourself.

71
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,079
Who told you that?

72
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,480
Your father?

73
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:03,471
For as long as I can remember,

74
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,791
<i>all I ever thought about
was myself,</i>

75
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:07,439
and that will not
be my legacy.

76
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,591
That will not the legacy
of Eobard Thawne!

77
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,680
Let me help you!

78
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,595
I don't want your help.

79
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,830
Not anymore.

80
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,756
<i>So we've got some good
news and some bad news.</i>

81
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,036
The good news is that CCPD
is still stationed outside

82
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:40,999
of Grace's room and will remain
so until Dwyer's been caught.

83
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,799
But the bad news is,
that means Dwyer won't

84
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,216
be visiting her again
anytime soon.

85
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,616
<i>And then the worst news is,</i>

86
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:47,552
we have no idea where Cicada
could be hiding.

87
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:50,599
Can't we just track him by
the dark energy in his dagger?

88
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:53,240
Well, we can, but only
when he uses it, which,

89
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:55,391
thank God,
hasn't been recently.

90
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:57,096
And he's not showing up
on facial recognition?

91
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,635
Unless he decides to make
an appearance, we've got zilch.

92
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:01,680
Which reminds me, where
the rest of Team Flash is?

93
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,717
Where's baby giraffe
and young Nora?

94
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,776
Ralph's visiting his mom.
He said to call if we need him.

95
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:08,269
- And Nora is...
- Right here.

96
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,256
I just stopped by the loft
to pick up your blue suit.

97
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,999
I figured you'd had enough
of green.

98
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,576
Hey, I made that green suit
work, though.

99
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,160
What is, uh,
that for again?

100
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:18,152
Mama Cecile's first day
back to the courtroom

101
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:20,152
and Dad's testimony
against Weather Witch.

102
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:21,839
Joss Jackam's trial
is later today.

103
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,559
It starts in 30 minutes.

104
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:26,314
Well, since my dad is with
Jenna visiting Wally,

105
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,596
why don't I come with you guys
and help support Cecile?

106
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,558
Yeah. When are they
coming back, by the way?

107
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:32,376
- They've been gone forever.
- Uh, he's not sure.

108
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,596
After having a psychopath
break into his home,

109
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,880
I don't think he's in any rush

110
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,416
to bring a newborn back
to Central City.

111
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,856
Besides, Cecile has a lot
on her plate

112
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,536
with this being
her first day back at work.

113
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,776
I can't wait to see
Weather Witch

114
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,800
get what she deserves.

115
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:49,149
Hey, you ready to get those
shards out of your hands?

116
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,276
Hell yes!

117
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:52,829
I haven't been able to play
PS4 properly for weeks.

118
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,639
See you in there.

119
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,560
Hey, you feel that?

120
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:58,756
Feel what?

121
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,797
That's the feeling
of free time.

122
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,951
AKA unbillable hours,

123
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,896
so we better not be seeing
any invoices from you

124
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:05,990
in the near future.

125
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,080
<i>Oh, that's all right.</i>

126
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:11,195
This is one mystery
I will solve for free.

127
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:34,519
<i>The state versus
Joslyn Jackam,</i>

128
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:39,516
Criminal Court of Central City,
meta-crime number 99512.

129
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,717
Welcome back to my courtroom,
Miss Horton.

130
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:45,157
I trust your maternity leave
was enjoyable?

131
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,600
Thank you, Your Honor.

132
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:49,275
I am very happy
to be back at work.

133
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,272
<i>Yeah, there never really is
enough time</i>

134
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,397
with a newborn, is there?

135
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:56,040
There is not.
You may proceed.

136
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,679
Thank you, Your Honor.

137
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,634
The prosecution
intends to prove

138
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,439
that between November 20th
and 27th,

139
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:05,160
Joslyn Jackam
used this device,

140
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,515
<i>a so-called piece of meta-tech,</i>

141
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:09,274
to unlawfully and intentionally

142
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,238
harm the citizens
of Central City.

143
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,674
<i>Her meta-crimes include</i>

144
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:14,911
<i>massive property damage
at Iron Heights,</i>

145
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,957
<i>the grounding
of 21 separate flights</i>

146
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,156
<i>at Sheldon County Airport,</i>

147
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,277
<i>and the attempted murder</i>

148
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:23,916
of her own father,
Mark Mardon.

149
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,310
Now, this attack
on her father was...

150
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,637
Uh...

151
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,189
Uh, the...

152
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,715
the attack on her father
was premeditated.

153
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,952
Um, and...

154
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:43,555
the prosecution
is seeking the...

155
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,597
Are you okay?

156
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,677
Uh...

157
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,597
yeah, it's just a...

158
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,114
feeling.

159
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,949
I'll be fine.

160
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,559
The prosecution is seeking the
maximum sentence, Your Honor.

161
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,160
<i>Gotcha.</i>

162
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,309
All right, almost done.

163
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,631
Micro-scale surgery
is not the easiest.

164
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,376
Is that why you missed these
the first time?

165
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,400
Hey, now!

166
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,114
All right, there you go.

167
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,510
Your hands are officially
dagger shard free.

168
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,600
Hallelu.

169
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,716
One more thing.

170
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:43,195
Mm, meta-sutures
for meta-wounds,

171
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,555
that's clever.

172
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:47,235
Ah! Note to self,
ice healing actually hurts.

173
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,760
Don't be a wuss.

174
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:52,712
Wuss.
You're the wuss.

175
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,632
Looks like you've got
this whole

176
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,279
Caitlyn/Killer Frost thing
down pat.

177
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,999
- Eh, not totally.
- I got it.

178
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:00,351
But it is getting easier
to switch to Killer Frost

179
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:02,193
when I need to.

180
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:04,840
So those sutures should stay
frozen while the wound heals.

181
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,759
Once they melt, you can
take the bandages off.

182
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:08,880
You'll be good to go.

183
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,997
I have to confess.

184
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:14,710
I've actually really enjoyed
not having my powers lately.

185
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,993
- Really?
- Yeah.

186
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:20,357
I got used to being Cisco again
sans Vibe-age, you know?

187
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:23,194
And not having villains
breathing down my neck

188
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,749
once a week, I have to say,
is pretty schway.

189
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,399
Well, if we're gonna
defeat Cicada,

190
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,119
we need
a fully functioning Vibe.

191
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,510
So hopefully
this does the trick.

192
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,273
Here, souvenirs.

193
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,955
- Oh, thank you so much.
- You're welcome.

194
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,640
<i>Opening statements
are underway</i>

195
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:44,478
<i>in the trial of Joss Jackam,</i>

196
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:47,359
<i>otherwise known
as Weather Witch.</i>

197
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,390
Just saying,
nothing wrong

198
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,233
with three or four
martinis at lunch.

199
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:57,357
It is when you get in
your Lamborghini and drive.

200
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,636
Sir, sir, focus here.

201
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:03,031
<i>Touch your nose.</i>

202
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,957
Hey! That's my car!

203
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,736
And then what happened,
Miss Pellett?

204
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:19,754
She created some kind
of lightning tornado.

205
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,911
<i>I wasn't sure if any of us
were gonna make it.</i>

206
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I got to go.

207
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:29,436
One moment, please.

208
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,272
I got to go.
There's been a car theft.

209
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,256
What are you talking about?
You're my lead CSI witness.

210
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:36,760
You're on the stand
in 30 minutes.

211
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,957
I'm sorry.
It's a Lamborghini, all right?

212
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:41,016
The cops aren't gonna be able
to keep up with this thing.

213
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,216
- It'll be quick.
- 30 minutes.

214
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,799
- All right.
<i>- Miss Horton?</i>

215
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:51,199
Hmm, where were we?

216
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:18,432
Guys, the car just turned
north on 8th,

217
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,716
- headed towards Wakefield.
<i>- Got it.</i>

218
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,439
Get ready to take
control of the wheel.

219
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:24,716
- What are you gonna do?
- Get the driver.

220
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,356
Here we go.

221
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,240
Dad!

222
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:55,190
- What's happening?
- I can't stop vibrating.

223
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,069
Guys! We need your help!
Guys!

224
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:05,949
- With what?
- With...

225
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,110
With that?

226
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,075
I can't stop phasing.

227
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:10,616
And I can't counter-phase him
forever.

228
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:11,835
Okay, that's not good.

229
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,718
If you keep going
but you don't,

230
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:14,870
then you could...

231
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,235
fall to your death.

232
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:18,670
- Yeah!
- What are we gonna do?

233
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,080
- Let him.
- Uh...

234
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,753
What?

235
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,274
Yes, if you phase
through the floor,

236
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,376
you're actually gonna fall
into pipeline cell

237
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,629
directly below us.

238
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,136
And the dampening unit
will negate your powers.

239
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:28,389
Unless we don't
time it right.

240
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,632
In which case, your torso would
be severed from your legs

241
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:32,949
<i>as you enter the cell.</i>

242
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,235
- Not helping.
- Stop, stop.

243
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,835
Okay, stop.
I tr... I trust you Cisco.

244
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,354
Move to the right.

245
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,635
No, my right.

246
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,399
Cisco! Come on!

247
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:43,312
Okay, stop right there!

248
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,039
One step back.
Cisco!

249
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,456
Actually, never mind,
one step forward.

250
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:50,110
Okay, ready?
Three, two, one, go!

251
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:09,080
<i>What's going on with me?</i>

252
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,440
<i>So...</i>

253
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:12,079
the car you touched

254
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:15,153
was saturated with
unstable dark matter.

255
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,576
And because you were phasing
at the time,

256
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,193
it caused your body
to destabilize

257
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,475
on a cellular level.

258
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:20,760
<i>When I got close
to the driver,</i>

259
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,240
<i>I saw dark matter veins
flare up,</i>

260
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,096
<i>just like on the back
of Spencer Young's phone.</i>

261
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:26,077
So the car is a piece
of meta-tech?

262
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,879
That or whatever was
controlling it.

263
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,736
How long is he gonna
have to stay in there for?

264
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,096
Without the help
of the power dampeners,

265
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,351
it could take up to a day?

266
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,416
<i>No, no, no, no! I-I have to
present evidence on the stand</i>

267
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,510
<i>in, like, ten minutes.</i>

268
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,670
<i>Cecile's gonna kill me.</i>

269
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,717
- That's not good.
- Um...

270
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,354
I could do it.

271
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,520
<i>You can't be serious.</i>

272
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,920
Well, when Dad
made me official,

273
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,456
he submitted my paperwork
to the court,

274
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:51,676
so I'm qualified to present
forensic evidence.

275
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:52,989
I can do this.

276
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:57,598
I cannot believe this is
happening on my first day back.

277
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,512
It's my first day back.
Okay.

278
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,035
Go to the court reporter.
Check in.

279
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:05,557
Tell her that Barry
was in a traffic accident.

280
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:06,915
Yes.

281
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,356
And, Nora, when you're
up there on the stand,

282
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,794
you just follow my lead.

283
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,712
- Got it?
- Mm-hmm.

284
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,239
Don't worry.
Nora can handle this.

285
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,320
<i>It's not that.</i>

286
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:18,796
I've decided I'm gonna pursue
a lighter sentence.

287
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,439
Why the change of heart?

288
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:23,160
Because I keep feeling these

289
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:27,274
waves of remorse
coming off of Joss.

290
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,317
I think she just wants
to start over

291
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,960
so she doesn't turn out
like her father.

292
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:35,638
So, Miss West,
can you explain what effect

293
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:38,554
these conditions had on
the Sheldon County Airport?

294
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:40,199
The facility was hit by winds

295
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:43,557
<i>ranging from
150 to 250 miles per hour.</i>

296
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:46,792
Wow, that's...
that is pretty dangerous.

297
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:52,239
And yet not a single person
was injured.

298
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,232
Well, no,
but that was because...

299
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,160
What about these
lightning marks on the tarmac?

300
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,476
Would you say that
that is common,

301
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,233
given the nature of the weather

302
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,720
during the incident
in question?

303
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,951
Yes, but luckily,
in this case,

304
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:05,394
the lightning only hit
the runway

305
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:06,816
and not
the surrounding structures.

306
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:09,912
The structures where all
of the passengers were.

307
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,471
I would say
that is pretty lucky indeed.

308
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:16,876
Your Honor,
the prosecution rests.

309
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,991
So that's it? You're not
gonna ask me anything else?

310
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,357
Well, it would appear so.

311
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:30,276
Mr. Lee, I think you're up.

312
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:38,991
Miss West,
is my client a meta-human?

313
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:41,675
No, but she used meta-tech.

314
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,080
Specifically a weather staff

315
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:45,959
that was corrupted
by dark matter.

316
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:50,080
So one could say it was
the staff, not my client,

317
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:52,396
that attacked the Sheldon
County Airport that night?

318
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:56,269
No, one couldn't.
She used that staff.

319
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:58,511
But isn't this just
an ordinary weather staff

320
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:59,795
corrupted by dark matter?

321
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:01,837
These are your words.

322
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:03,553
- Yes, but...
- And since dark matter

323
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:05,040
was able to corrupt a tool

324
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,032
and turn it into a weapon
of destruction,

325
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,510
isn't it also possible it could
corrupt the defendant?

326
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,513
<i>No. Dark matter doesn't
make you do things.</i>

327
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:15,599
She pointed lightning at a
hangar full of scared families.

328
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:18,752
Your Honor, there were
little kids in that hangar.

329
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:21,016
Did you know that... that
lightning is five times hotter

330
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,679
<i>than the surface
of the sun?</i>

331
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:25,673
That is the kind of power
that the defendant unleashed

332
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,080
upon those people.

333
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:29,356
She did this.

334
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,955
This was her choice,
and she can't be trusted.

335
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,918
No, Miss West,
you must sit down.

336
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,256
I know, but, Your Honor...

337
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:37,397
<i>- Sit down!</i>
- No! She's right.

338
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,278
I'm guilty,

339
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,352
and I should pay
for what I did.

340
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:50,591
- What you doing?
- Get a load of this.

341
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:52,000
You know those shards
you removed?

342
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,679
I ran a biochemical analysis
on them

343
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:54,880
and the tissue
from my hands.

344
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,030
You know how to do that?

345
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:58,794
I picked up a thing or two
from Caitlin Snow MD

346
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:02,556
over the years,
and I found this.

347
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,112
That's my tissue
right after I got sliced.

348
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,032
Mm-hmm.

349
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,713
That's from today.

350
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,871
Almost all the dark matter
is gone.

351
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,838
The shards weren't dampening
my powers.

352
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,434
They were removing them.

353
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:17,751
So the dagger has
anti-dark matter properties.

354
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,194
Yes!

355
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:21,016
Cisco, if we could synthesize
that into a serum,

356
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,316
we could get rid
of Cicada's powers entirely.

357
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,676
And not just his powers,
everyone's.

358
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:28,070
- Everyone's?
- Caitlyn,

359
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,550
we could make
a meta-human cure.

360
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,390
You think we need
a meta-human cure?

361
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:35,755
Don't you?

362
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:37,240
Um...

363
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,354
Okay, maybe not.

364
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:42,274
But I seem to remember
a time when you did?

365
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:44,511
Sure, when I first discovered
Killer Frost,

366
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,114
I wanted to get rid of her.

367
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:50,479
But when she was gone, it felt
like a piece of me was missing.

368
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:53,359
Besides, we have seen
meta-human powers

369
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,318
do really good things.

370
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,869
Okay, yeah! If you can
build an ice bridge

371
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,599
to avoid rush hour traffic,

372
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:02,798
but what if my existence
gives everyone around me

373
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:05,793
radiation poisoning
like Fallout?

374
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:08,759
Those metas, we created them
against their will.

375
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,837
No, Thawne created
the particle accelerator

376
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,354
and he sabotaged it.

377
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:14,440
And who shattered the
satellite full of dark matter

378
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,233
and created God knows
how many metas?

379
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:17,470
We did that.

380
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:21,474
This cure could give
meta-humans a second chance

381
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,159
at having a normal life.

382
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:25,994
Maybe not everyone wants
a normal life, Cisco.

383
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,878
Look out!

384
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:07,199
Who does this lady
think she is?

385
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:18,680
What the hell?

386
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,236
Who are you?

387
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,755
Your ride.
Let's go.

388
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:46,393
So Joss Jackam never made it
to Iron Heights.

389
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:48,113
Nope, and
the transport driver said

390
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,456
that the woman who took her
used something

391
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:51,437
that completely
shut down his truck.

392
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:52,715
Pause.

393
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,996
<i>That. Look familiar?</i>

394
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:56,753
Ugh, another piece
of satellite shard.

395
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:58,593
So the fob is the meta-tech?

396
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:00,696
Yeah, probably sends out
some kind of dark matter pulse

397
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,757
that overrides any
guidance system in seconds.

398
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:04,320
So as long as
she has an engine,

399
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,754
she can control it
and we still

400
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,320
don't even know
who we're looking for.

401
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:10,034
Maybe we do.
Hey, can you fast-forward?

402
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,199
<i>Stop.</i>

403
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:16,159
Yeah, look, that salute.
She's definitely military.

404
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:19,756
Okay, let's run that face
through the DOD database.

405
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,519
<i>Raya Van Zandt.</i>

406
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:27,360
Former Air Force,
ace pilot, mechanic,

407
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:30,274
and expert
in vehicle operations.

408
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:32,875
She was
dishonorably discharged.

409
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:35,714
Call sign was Silver Ghost.
Huh?

410
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:38,554
The rest of her
military record was sealed.

411
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,736
Okay, well, I'm gonna see
if my dad can call in a favor

412
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:41,816
and maybe we can get a copy.

413
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,479
Yeah, and in the meantime,

414
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:45,376
it looks like we have
two bad girls to track down.

415
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,232
I'm not so sure, Nora.

416
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:49,915
I mean, Cecile said that
she could feel Joss' remorse.

417
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:52,032
Come on, Mom.
That was a show.

418
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:54,510
I mean, do you think
this escape was a coincidence?

419
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,239
Uh, well,
we don't know yet, Nora.

420
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,320
<i>Yes, we do.</i>

421
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,790
Raya got that fob to break Joss
out of the prison transport.

422
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,633
I guarantee you Joss
is a part of this.

423
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:02,760
How do you know that?

424
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:04,752
Because bad people
don't change.

425
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:09,875
<i>Hey, guys, any way</i>

426
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:12,077
<i>you could send down
some food?</i>

427
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:17,350
Welcome to home base.

428
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:18,954
Home base of what?

429
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,633
The Young Rogues.

430
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,712
There's been enough
old men running this town.

431
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:23,870
Our turn.

432
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:26,399
I have my eyes
on a few candidates,

433
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:29,279
but for this job, plan on it
just being you and me.

434
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:32,000
Um,
I'm not planning anything!

435
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,675
I don't even know who you are!
Just take me back!

436
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,834
<i>You ever heard of A.R.G.U.S.?</i>

437
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:43,277
It's an off-the-grid facility
primed with bleeding-edge tech,

438
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,953
<i>and it's protected by one</i>

439
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:48,192
<i>of the most advanced
security systems on Earth.</i>

440
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:51,032
The only thing that can
short it out is

441
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:53,316
a billion joules
of electricity.

442
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,873
So a few bolts of lightning.

443
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,429
You're the Weather Witch,
right?

444
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:03,434
Beneath this wall is
the facility's power junction.

445
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:07,036
You hit that and we have
a four-minute window

446
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:10,790
to get something that
will make us unstoppable.

447
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:13,554
No, look,
even if I was gonna help you,

448
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:15,074
and I'm not,

449
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,896
I need my weather staff
to control any of that,

450
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:18,256
and right now,
that is in police holdup.

451
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:20,636
So if you could
just take me back.

452
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,198
Okay.

453
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,394
<i>To do what?</i>

454
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,279
Turn myself in.

455
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:32,431
I see.

456
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:34,313
You don't want to be
like your dad.

457
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,596
I get that,
but it's too late.

458
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:39,832
You're a criminal.
So am I.

459
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:41,832
And those people out there,

460
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:44,958
trust me, all they think is,
"Like father, like daughter."

461
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:47,096
But I guess you need to find
that out for yourself,

462
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,395
don't you?

463
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:53,909
Find me when you do.

464
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,510
Thank you.

465
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:06,319
- Well... right.
- Yeah.

466
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,232
That will hold you
until you get out... oh!

467
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:13,816
Uh, can I ask you a question?

468
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,160
Uh, do you have a minute?

469
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:16,515
Yeah.

470
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:17,829
Yes, you're not
going anywhere.

471
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:21,630
So, um, last year, you came
out of the Speed Force

472
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:25,031
and you were writing
a kind of a symbol language.

473
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:26,120
Do you remember that?

474
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:28,476
- Yeah, I remember.
- And apparently,

475
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:30,836
Cisco could only translate
one of these phrases.

476
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:31,920
Right?

477
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,151
So far, yeah. I mean,
Gideon couldn't even do it.

478
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,759
Gideon.

479
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:38,559
Right, Gideon.

480
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,791
So what do you think
that language was?

481
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:44,197
I don't know. It was some
kind of, uh, chronolinguistics.

482
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:46,040
Chronolinguistics
that you got from your time

483
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:47,776
in the Speed Force, which
is all time at once, right?

484
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,314
Past, present, future.

485
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:51,256
What do you think this
language was? Future, maybe?

486
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:54,079
Why? Is this about Cicada?

487
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:58,677
Cicada? No, no.
No, It's just, um...

488
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:00,240
<i>le mystère,</i> huh?

489
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:02,056
I'm a detective.
I see mystery everywhere, so...

490
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:04,151
- Uh-huh.
- Uh, all right. Thank you.

491
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,515
See you next time.

492
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:08,752
Okay... oh!
Ah, before I forget,

493
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:11,514
the Legends, uh,
dropped off some, um, books

494
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,000
to help you pass the time.

495
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,760
- Huh.
<i>- Uncaged Desire.</i>

496
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,593
You're kind of caged desire.

497
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:19,637
- Hope you enjoy it.
- Huh.

498
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:21,393
- See you next time.
- Thanks.

499
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:23,233
Yeah, probably not very good.

500
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:24,595
See you!

501
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:29,236
<i>What is it?</i>

502
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:32,472
According to Doppler, it's
a hurricane in Central City.

503
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:35,234
No, it's not a hurricane.
It's Joss.

504
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:37,560
I'm on it.

505
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,519
What, no Flash today?

506
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:48,876
Figured he wasn't needed
to stop a fake hurricane.

507
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:52,910
Guess we can add
damaging private property

508
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,559
to your résumé.

509
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:55,760
Look, I just need your help.

510
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:57,871
Oh, stop with the sorry act.

511
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,872
That ended when your friend
helped you escape.

512
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,152
She is not my buddy,
and I did not escape.

513
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:05,873
Look,

514
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:07,474
I want to turn myself back in.

515
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:09,160
Oh, you really expect me
to believe that?

516
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:12,079
My dad
is the career criminal,

517
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:13,355
not me.

518
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,272
I just...

519
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:18,080
I want to show everybody

520
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:20,675
that I'm not the person
that they think I am.

521
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:22,353
Then what do you need me for?

522
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:23,630
You're a hero.

523
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:24,720
If you vouch for me,

524
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:27,360
people will know
that I'm telling the truth.

525
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:30,638
Look, I will tell you
everything.

526
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,837
I'll even show you
where that woman took me.

527
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:37,996
Just give me a chance.

528
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:46,193
If anyone asks,
you never saw this.

529
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:47,475
Thank you, Major Morgan.

530
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:48,576
Please tell
the Lieutenant General

531
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:49,800
that my dad and I owe him one.

532
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:57,030
Special delivery.
One Weather Witch.

533
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:59,760
What? I thought you were
gonna help me.

534
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:01,194
I'm trying to turn myself in.

535
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:04,637
No, I-I didn't escape.
I-I was kidnapped.

536
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:05,790
Will you please tell them?

537
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:08,190
Sorry,
I don't trust criminals.

538
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:10,192
She's all yours.

539
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:13,279
No! No, no!
This is a misunderstanding!

540
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:14,476
This is unfair!

541
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:16,631
If I could just talk to her,
please!

542
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,677
<i>Your father does
the exact same thing.</i>

543
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:35,838
When something's on his mind,
he runs.

544
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:38,480
Nothing's on my mind, Mom.

545
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,756
I got to take a look at
Raya Van Zandt's DOD file.

546
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:42,433
Oh, yeah,
did you find the connection

547
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:43,880
between her and Joss?

548
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:46,794
Well, there doesn't seem
to be one.

549
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:47,880
Really?

550
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:50,475
<i>Yeah, she left the Air Force</i>

551
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:52,677
after a failed mission
overseas,

552
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:55,434
and then she spent two months
on desk duty,

553
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:58,194
and then she was
dishonorably discharged.

554
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:02,958
But it seems like she has
a pretty good service record.

555
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:05,675
Exactly, so clearly
the DOD had egg on its face

556
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,831
and Raya became its scapegoat.

557
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,189
I'm just saying, Nora,

558
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:11,078
not everyone is
as bad as they seem.

559
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:15,677
Raya, Joss. I think everyone
deserves a second chance.

560
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:18,315
If you don't believe me,
ask your father.

561
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,835
He gives more second chances
than anyone I've ever met.

562
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:31,151
Come on. Come on.

563
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:38,597
Yes. Yes!
Yes, yes, yes!

564
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:42,436
Yes!

565
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:56,915
What the hell are you doing?

566
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,957
What the hell
are <i>you</i> doing?

567
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:02,279
Well, I was distilling
dark matter ore

568
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:03,840
from Cicada's dagger shards.

569
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:05,752
But I can't really
do that anymore, can I?

570
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:06,840
Whoops.

571
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:08,354
Why did you do that?

572
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,631
You're smart.
You can figure it out.

573
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,016
When are you
gonna figure out that

574
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:13,560
a meta-cure could
actually help people?

575
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:15,711
Listen, I heard all about it,
short stuff.

576
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,280
But you know what?
Caity and I,

577
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:18,999
we're doing just fine,

578
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:22,232
and so were you until Cicada
got all up in your head.

579
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,437
Don't do that.
This isn't just about me.

580
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:25,590
<i>Oh, the hell it isn't!</i>

581
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:27,558
And... and you know what?
I get it.

582
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:29,359
He tried to kill you.

583
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,671
<i>You're trying to create
something that'll save us all.</i>

584
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,353
Yeah, I am!

585
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:35,079
All of us!

586
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:37,436
Barry, Iris, Nora,
they have a family.

587
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,637
Even you and Caitlyn have
your weird little family.

588
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,558
But what about my family?

589
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:44,752
I want a wife
to grow old with.

590
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:46,479
I want a kid.

591
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:49,069
And I don't want them
to wonder all the time

592
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:50,480
if their dad is in trouble,

593
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:52,279
if he's even gonna
make it home tonight.

594
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:54,216
Cisco, you don't have
to choose between having powers

595
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,469
and having a family.

596
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:57,552
Yeah?
Well, some of us do.

597
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:59,518
I'm not the Flash.

598
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,553
I don't want to be the Flash.

599
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:06,674
I want to be me.

600
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,634
A cure is the only way.

601
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,438
Or it was.

602
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,712
What?

603
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:27,315
Oh, come on, girl.

604
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:31,312
<i>You're reading Mick's book?</i>

605
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:33,676
This is...

606
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:36,036
surprisingly well-written.

607
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:41,917
What's going on?

608
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:48,357
Just having a hard time
believing

609
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:50,352
some people can change.

610
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,671
How come?

611
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:59,878
'Cause after everything
that you've seen,

612
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:02,156
don't you think that
bad people stay bad?

613
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,356
<i>Not always.</i>

614
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:06,433
When I first met Leonard Snart,
he was a criminal.

615
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:08,273
Probably the worst criminal
in the city.

616
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:09,396
But I...

617
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:10,675
<i>you know, I knew</i>

618
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:12,640
<i>that there was a good person
in there somewhere,</i>

619
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:13,790
<i>and look at him.</i>

620
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:15,439
Turned out to be a Legend.

621
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,753
Died a hero.

622
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:21,639
<i>If he can change,
anyone can.</i>

623
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:23,393
You really believe that?

624
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,597
Yeah. I do.

625
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:31,830
What about Eobard Thawne?

626
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,399
I think...

627
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:40,080
part of being a hero

628
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:42,720
is being able to see
the good in people.

629
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:47,715
So yeah,
maybe someday in the future...

630
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:52,276
even Thawne could change.

631
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:55,319
Besides,
if we don't believe in people,

632
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:56,720
who will?

633
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:19,915
Very funny!

634
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,953
I got 595s!

635
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,753
<i>We got a lot of vehicles!
Let's go.</i>

636
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:34,593
<i>Copy that. Suit up!</i>

637
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:37,798
We've got multiple 595s
in our own parking lot!

638
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:39,553
<i>Get out there quick!</i>

639
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:41,518
<i>Requesting more backup!
We've got a lot!</i>

640
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:47,039
What are you doing here?

641
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:51,598
Doing what no one else
is gonna do for you...

642
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:59,036
Offer you a second chance...

643
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:00,440
Weather Witch.

644
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:10,756
<i>That's it.</i>

645
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:12,797
That's where
the power junction is.

646
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,917
Give it everything you got.

647
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:35,536
- What the hell was that?
<i>- I don't know, sir.</i>

648
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:38,120
But it knocked out
security grids 41 through 60.

649
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:47,795
Ten years
and $24 million later,

650
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:51,157
the stealth automobile,
AKA the SAM, was born.

651
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:53,197
Rumor has it that everything
under its hood

652
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:55,033
comes directly from WayneTech.

653
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:04,955
This is a $24-million
prototype?

654
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:07,670
What can it do?

655
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,638
Let's find out.

656
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:29,199
Is it Joss or Raya?

657
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,976
I'm guessing both
because someone just stole

658
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,719
a very expensive vehicle
from A.R.G.U.S.

659
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:34,473
after a very precise
lightning strike.

660
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:36,119
It's a next-gen prototype

661
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:37,634
<i>with all the bells
and whistles.</i>

662
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:40,110
If bells and whistles could
explode and murder people.

663
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:41,680
And supposedly
it's untrackable.

664
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,080
<i>So how do we find it?</i>

665
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:44,616
- We don't search for the car.
- We search for them.

666
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,233
If Joss made lightning
strike again,

667
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:47,436
<i>it means she has her staff.</i>

668
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:49,557
Oh, so we can track
the dark matter in it. Nice!

669
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:50,960
<i>I got the location.</i>

670
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:55,917
<i>Okay, remember, Nora,
whatever you do,</i>

671
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,515
<i>don't touch the car
while using your powers.</i>

672
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:01,160
Hey, Caitlin, can I steal you
for a second?

673
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:20,311
Joyride's over,
Silver Ghost.

674
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:22,915
Joss,
I need to talk to you.

675
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:26,595
Hard pass.

676
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:48,151
Got to love
remote detonation.

677
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:04,719
Icy roads ahead.

678
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,834
Oh, my God. Whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, Raya!

679
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:13,718
Raya!

680
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:30,475
<i>Holy Buckaroo Banzai.</i>

681
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:32,552
It phases?

682
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:34,359
Whatever phase-trick
they just used,

683
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:35,476
it jammed our tracking.

684
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:36,789
We can't get a lock on them

685
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:38,336
if she doesn't use
that weather staff.

686
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:40,750
XS is gonna come after us.

687
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:41,876
Let her try.

688
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:53,914
<i>Hear no evil, see no evil.</i>

689
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,593
We're invisible.

690
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:01,234
Hey, Cisco?

691
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:03,312
Can you connect me
to the car's comm system?

692
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:05,915
No, but best I can do is
have you send out radio waves,

693
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:08,111
and if the car's nearby,
it'll pick them up.

694
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:09,554
Do it.

695
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:16,680
<i>Joss? Joss, it's XS.
I hope you can hear me.</i>

696
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,835
You tried to tell me
something earlier.

697
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:22,600
<i>You tried to tell me
that you wanted to pay</i>

698
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:24,632
<i>for the crimes
that you committed.</i>

699
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:26,677
<i>You said you weren't
a criminal like your father.</i>

700
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:28,638
You asked me to give you
a second chance,

701
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:30,120
<i>but I didn't listen.</i>

702
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:32,669
Now I'm asking you
for a second chance.

703
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:35,992
<i>Joss,
this isn't who you are.</i>

704
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:42,878
Nora, the car's headed
straight for you.

705
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:45,600
I don't see anything.

706
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:53,154
<i>Nora, look out!</i>

707
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:03,391
How the hell
did I lose control?

708
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:08,198
Hey, hold on to me.
This is gonna feel weird.

709
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:16,079
Well, at least
we got their wheels.

710
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:17,355
What's left of them.

711
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:19,511
Thanks for
the last-minute rescue.

712
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:22,035
- For the what?
- Icing up the road.

713
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:23,520
I didn't ice the road.

714
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:25,637
What? Who...

715
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:36,113
And...

716
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:38,112
time! 24 hours are up.

717
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:40,192
Okay, I double-checked
with Caitlin,

718
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:42,216
and there doesn't seem to be
any unstable dark matter

719
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:43,356
in your biometric scans.

720
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,671
Okay.

721
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:54,880
Man, it feels good
to be out of there.

722
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:56,080
We definitely missed you,
Dad.

723
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:57,936
Sorry I haven't been able
to help with everything.

724
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:59,376
Do we know where
Joss and Raya are now?

725
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:00,400
No, we got nothing yet.

726
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:01,675
But you were right
about Joss.

727
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:02,910
She saved my life.

728
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,360
If she hadn't iced over
the road...

729
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:06,397
But she did because
you connected with her.

730
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:07,480
<i>It's like Dad said,</i>

731
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:09,711
she just needed someone
to believe in her.

732
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:11,598
Sounds like you found
your own Leonard Snart.

733
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:14,036
Well, time might prove me wrong,
but I think so.

734
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:15,190
I hope so.

735
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:17,237
I'm sorry I messed up
your first day back.

736
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:19,960
It's all right, Nora.
There's always day two.

737
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:21,713
- I'm happy you're back.
- Thanks.

738
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:23,399
Hey, do you wanna
help me find Cisco?

739
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:25,756
I gotta get this extrapolator
thing recalibrated.

740
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:29,038
I went to go see Joe in Tibet,
and I ended up in Fiji.

741
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:34,278
Being a parent
sure is hard sometimes.

742
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:36,556
Yeah, it is.

743
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:38,472
But there's nothing like it.

744
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:56,399
Okay, well, we can't both
be the basket case.

745
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:58,039
"We're all pretty bizarre.

746
00:37:58,120 --> 00:38:00,396
Some of us are just better
at hiding it."

747
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:01,880
Come on, <i>Breakfast Club?</i>

748
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:03,235
It's one of the only movies

749
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:05,118
Killer Frost and I
actually agree on.

750
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:06,256
Let me guess,
she's into Bender?

751
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:08,397
- Totally. She loves him.
- Yeah, makes sense.

752
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:09,914
- I'd ship that.
<i>- Put that on.</i>

753
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,356
It's cold where we're going.

754
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:20,110
Your dad's old lab.

755
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:21,839
- Mm-hmm.
- Cool.

756
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:24,435
Caitlin,
why did you bring me here?

757
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:27,160
Because despite our
last encounter with him,

758
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:29,397
he did create a meta-gene.

759
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:31,836
So I was thinking that you
could use his research

760
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:33,752
to do the reverse.

761
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:36,230
Um, okay,

762
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:39,233
don't look now, but if I
didn't know any better,

763
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:44,554
I'd say this feels a lot
like you helping me

764
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:46,950
make a meta-human cure.

765
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,200
I couldn't stop
thinking about

766
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:50,357
what you said
about how a cure

767
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:54,559
would give you a second chance
at a normal life.

768
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:57,235
No friend would stand
in the way of that.

769
00:38:57,320 --> 00:39:02,190
But there is a difference
between you standing in my way

770
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:05,591
and you actively helping me.

771
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:08,434
I still think this is
dangerous, but...

772
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:11,274
maybe if I'm involved,
we can have some ground rules.

773
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:13,556
Like the first
and most important,

774
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:17,873
we will never,
ever force a cure on anyone.

775
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:21,472
Okay.

776
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:23,677
Rule number one.

777
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:26,636
We're not just here
to make a cure.

778
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:28,920
We're here to make a choice.

779
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:49,874
Nora.

780
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:54,109
You either trust me,
or you don't.

781
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,833
There's no in-between.

782
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:01,357
Fine.

783
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:03,591
I don't trust you.

784
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:06,434
But I'm willing to give you
the chance to change my mind.

785
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:11,114
Well,
that might take some time.

786
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:15,831
And time,
as you may recall,

787
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:18,799
is not on my side.

788
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:20,837
Minutes are minutes,

789
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:24,038
seconds are seconds,

790
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:26,794
and there's very few
of them left.

791
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:36,834
I want to believe that

792
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:38,720
there is good inside
of you somewhere, Thawne.

793
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,798
Let me prove there is.

794
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:53,156
Okay.

795
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:02,152
What's next?

796
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:32,595
<i>Hello, Dr. Wells.</i>

797
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:36,117
Hello, Gideon.

798
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:38,669
I have access to all the files?

799
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:40,592
- Right?
<i>- Of course.</i>

800
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:42,956
<i>Which files would you
like me to locate?</i>

801
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:46,431
I would like you
to locate the files

802
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:48,432
from Nora West-Allen.

803
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:49,590
<i>I'm sorry, Dr. Wells,</i>

804
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:51,416
<i>but all entries have been
permanently deleted</i>

805
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:52,760
<i>by Nora West-Allen.</i>

806
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:23,554
<i>Greg, move your head.</i>
