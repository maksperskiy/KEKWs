1
00:02:42,843 --> 00:02:44,970
We're all familiar
with the illegal poaching...

2
00:02:45,078 --> 00:02:47,103
of endangered animals
in the wild...

3
00:02:47,214 --> 00:02:51,913
but never before has an animal in
captivity been slaughtered for its pelt.

4
00:02:51,985 --> 00:02:55,477
Animal protection groups
that monitor the international trade...

5
00:02:55,555 --> 00:02:57,955
in game contraband
have further told us...

6
00:02:58,024 --> 00:03:00,686
that a white Siberian tiger
is so rare that the offer...

7
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:03,058
- Of a pelt would surely
draw the attention...

8
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:05,357
Of law enforcement agencies.

9
00:03:05,432 --> 00:03:07,423
Shortly before dawn this morning...

10
00:03:07,534 --> 00:03:11,334
security staff at London Zoo
discovered the excoriated carcass...

11
00:03:11,404 --> 00:03:16,034
of its prized three-year-old
female Siberian tiger, Sue Ling.

12
00:03:16,109 --> 00:03:17,838
Police sources have suggested...

13
00:03:17,911 --> 00:03:21,005
that the killing was contracted
by a private collector.

14
00:03:21,081 --> 00:03:24,141
Oh, isn't that horrible?
Who'd do a thing like that?

15
00:03:24,251 --> 00:03:27,277
If the battle to preserve
endangered species has moved
into the urban zoological park...

16
00:03:27,354 --> 00:03:30,619
we must ask ourselves if
any animal in the world is safe.

17
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:34,217
- This is Tim Ryan,
reporting from London Zoo.

18
00:03:34,261 --> 00:03:35,250
- This is Tim Ryan,
reporting from London Zoo.

19
00:04:11,998 --> 00:04:15,229
Another bad day
for the animal kingdom.

20
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:19,404
Oh, one day...

21
00:04:19,472 --> 00:04:22,999
very soon, Pongo,
I'm going to make a sale.

22
00:04:23,109 --> 00:04:27,045
We're fast approaching the point
where I'm gonna have to start
eating your table scraps.

23
00:04:29,149 --> 00:04:31,208
Oh.

24
00:04:31,284 --> 00:04:34,048
I was exaggerating.
Well, shall we?

25
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:36,518
It's not that bad.

26
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:38,888
It's very important
this meeting goes well.

27
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:40,893
You know how I am about meetings.

28
00:04:40,961 --> 00:04:42,895
I tend to get a little, well, nervous.

29
00:04:42,963 --> 00:04:45,989
When I get nervous, I say things, I do
things I shouldn't say, I shouldn't do.

30
00:04:46,099 --> 00:04:50,058
- And the next thing
we know, freelancing.

31
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:57,140
He's got the best instincts
in the industry.

32
00:04:57,210 --> 00:05:01,169
Since he was six, he's picked
the top-selling game every year.

33
00:05:07,654 --> 00:05:10,555
Ow!

34
00:05:18,598 --> 00:05:19,997
Well?

35
00:05:20,066 --> 00:05:22,694
What do you think?

36
00:05:22,769 --> 00:05:26,102
Potentially good graphics,
reasonably entertaining premise...

37
00:05:26,172 --> 00:05:29,300
the dog's well-conceived
and the environments are engaging.

38
00:05:29,376 --> 00:05:31,844
But I'm not interested
in a game that has...

39
00:05:31,911 --> 00:05:34,641
a chubby little dogcatcher
as the bad guy.

40
00:05:34,714 --> 00:05:37,376
Even girls won't like this game.

41
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:40,908
- Sorry, mate.
- Yeah, but wait, wait, wait.
Herbert, wait!

42
00:05:40,987 --> 00:05:43,888
What if there were a better villain?
You know, someone you could really hate?

43
00:05:45,525 --> 00:05:49,461
It's not hatred that's important.
It's a desire to annihilate.

44
00:06:15,989 --> 00:06:18,048
Top of the morning
to ya, Ma'am.

45
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,374
Morning, Ma'am.

46
00:06:36,743 --> 00:06:38,677
Morning, Miss De Vil's office.
Could you hold, please?

47
00:06:38,745 --> 00:06:41,179
Yes, I'll be with you in a moment.
Could you hold, please?

48
00:06:41,247 --> 00:06:43,909
Thank you. Good morning,
Miss De Vil's office. Could you hold?

49
00:06:43,983 --> 00:06:45,416
Good morning, Miss De Vil.

50
00:06:48,421 --> 00:06:50,753
- Morning, Miss De Vil.
- Morning.

51
00:06:56,796 --> 00:06:58,730
Morning, Ma'am.

52
00:07:08,174 --> 00:07:11,439
Anita, darling.

53
00:07:11,511 --> 00:07:13,445
Good morning, Cruella.

54
00:07:27,494 --> 00:07:30,088
- What a charming dog.
- Thank you.

55
00:07:30,196 --> 00:07:33,165
- Spots?
- Yes, she's dalmatian.

56
00:07:33,266 --> 00:07:35,632
- Inspiration?
- Yes.

57
00:07:35,702 --> 00:07:37,795
- Long hair or short?
- Short.

58
00:07:37,871 --> 00:07:41,739
- Coarse or fine?
- I'm afraid it is a little coarse.

59
00:07:41,808 --> 00:07:44,470
- Pity!
- But it was very fine
when she was a puppy.

60
00:07:44,544 --> 00:07:48,139
Redemption! We need to have
a little girl talk.

61
00:07:48,214 --> 00:07:50,273
Come to my office.

62
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:52,614
Bring the drawing.

63
00:07:52,685 --> 00:07:55,449
Now, darling, tell me
more about these spots.

64
00:07:55,522 --> 00:07:57,456
I did leopard spots
in the '80s.

65
00:07:57,524 --> 00:07:59,992
Well, dalmatian spots are
a little different, aren't they?

66
00:08:00,059 --> 00:08:02,823
- Cozy. Classic.
- Cuddly. Less trashy.

67
00:08:02,929 --> 00:08:06,126
Exactly!
Do you like spots, Frederick?

68
00:08:06,199 --> 00:08:09,657
Oh, I don't believe so, Madame.
I thought we liked stripes this year.

69
00:08:09,736 --> 00:08:11,966
What kind of sycophant are you?

70
00:08:12,038 --> 00:08:16,031
Um, what kind of sycophant
would you like me to be?

71
00:08:16,109 --> 00:08:18,805
Frederick...

72
00:08:18,878 --> 00:08:22,575
I'm beginning to see spots.

73
00:08:22,649 --> 00:08:26,346
- What would it cost us to start
again on next year's line?
- Millions.

74
00:08:26,419 --> 00:08:28,819
- Can we afford it?
- Well, yes...

75
00:08:28,888 --> 00:08:33,018
Pay it, darling. Now go away.
I have to talk to Anita.

76
00:08:33,126 --> 00:08:35,287
Alonzo?

77
00:08:35,395 --> 00:08:38,228
Did you ask Anita if
she'd like something to drink?

78
00:08:39,999 --> 00:08:43,332
Oh, I-I... I'm fine, thank you.

79
00:08:47,006 --> 00:08:48,940
Sit down, please.

80
00:08:52,478 --> 00:08:55,072
How long have you been
working for me?

81
00:08:55,148 --> 00:08:57,412
Uh, two years last August.

82
00:08:57,483 --> 00:09:01,544
- And you've done
wonderful work in that time.
- Thank you.

83
00:09:01,621 --> 00:09:04,522
- I don't see you socially, do I?
- No.

84
00:09:04,591 --> 00:09:08,550
And you're not very well-known,
despite your obvious talent.

85
00:09:08,628 --> 00:09:11,529
Well, notoriety doesn't
mean very much to me.

86
00:09:11,598 --> 00:09:15,762
Your work is fresh and clean,
unfettered, unpretentious.

87
00:09:15,835 --> 00:09:17,860
It sells.
And one of these days...

88
00:09:17,937 --> 00:09:20,497
my competitors are going
to suss out who you are...

89
00:09:20,573 --> 00:09:22,700
and they're going
to try to steal you away.

90
00:09:22,775 --> 00:09:25,005
Oh, no. If I left,
it wouldn't be for another job.

91
00:09:25,078 --> 00:09:28,172
Oh, really?
What would it be for?

92
00:09:28,248 --> 00:09:30,808
Well, I don't know.

93
00:09:30,884 --> 00:09:34,718
Um, if I met someone, if working here
didn't fit in with our plans.

94
00:09:34,787 --> 00:09:37,756
- Marriage.
- Perhaps.

95
00:09:37,824 --> 00:09:40,088
More good women have been
lost to marriage...

96
00:09:40,193 --> 00:09:43,458
than to war, famine,
disease and disaster.

97
00:09:43,529 --> 00:09:46,794
You have talent, darling.
Don't squander it.

98
00:09:46,866 --> 00:09:50,267
Well, I don't think that it's something
we have to worry about.

99
00:09:50,336 --> 00:09:53,794
- I don't have any prospects.
- Thank God.

100
00:09:53,873 --> 00:09:56,103
Well, I should be
getting back to work.

101
00:09:56,175 --> 00:09:59,542
Yes, please do.
Alonzo.

102
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:05,312
The drawing.

103
00:10:07,954 --> 00:10:10,548
Take the drawing from Anita
and hand it to me!

104
00:10:10,623 --> 00:10:13,148
Is that difficult?

105
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:19,195
Thank you.

106
00:10:19,265 --> 00:10:22,200
Now go. Stand somewhere 'til I need you.

107
00:10:24,537 --> 00:10:27,802
I look wonderful in spots.

108
00:10:27,874 --> 00:10:32,311
However, I would like
to make one small change.

109
00:10:34,347 --> 00:10:38,010
We could do this in linen.

110
00:10:38,084 --> 00:10:40,177
It would be stunning in fur.

111
00:10:40,253 --> 00:10:42,244
But you'll be wearing it
to the Chesterton Trials.

112
00:10:42,322 --> 00:10:44,586
That's in April.
Fur would be inappropriate.

113
00:10:44,691 --> 00:10:46,989
But it's my only true love, darling.

114
00:10:47,093 --> 00:10:49,926
I live for fur. I worship fur.

115
00:10:49,996 --> 00:10:53,693
After all, is there a woman
in all this wretched world who doesn't?

116
00:10:53,766 --> 00:10:56,360
Give it to Anita.

117
00:10:57,937 --> 00:11:00,269
Oh.

118
00:11:05,244 --> 00:11:07,337
It is rather amusing, isn't it?

119
00:11:07,413 --> 00:11:09,176
What is?

120
00:11:09,248 --> 00:11:11,944
Well, if we make this coat...

121
00:11:12,018 --> 00:11:14,509
it would be as if
I were wearing your dog.

122
00:11:16,689 --> 00:11:19,817
Woof! Woof!

123
00:11:58,698 --> 00:12:01,565
Sorry, Pongo.
I didn't mean to take so long.

124
00:12:01,634 --> 00:12:05,468
- If I could just sell a game,
we might be able to get a car.

125
00:12:08,408 --> 00:12:10,205
Come on.

126
00:12:13,379 --> 00:12:15,438
Pongo!

127
00:12:19,419 --> 00:12:21,785
Pongo!

128
00:12:21,888 --> 00:12:23,321
Whoa!

129
00:12:26,659 --> 00:12:30,026
Pongo!
Slow down!

130
00:12:31,931 --> 00:12:34,092
- Slow down!
- Hey! Watch it!

131
00:12:38,337 --> 00:12:40,328
Oh!

132
00:12:42,008 --> 00:12:44,203
- Pongo!
- Hey!

133
00:12:44,277 --> 00:12:46,302
Whoa!

134
00:12:58,291 --> 00:13:00,555
Pongo! Pongo! Pongo!

135
00:13:06,966 --> 00:13:09,560
Aaah!

136
00:13:10,536 --> 00:13:12,902
Aaah!

137
00:13:13,973 --> 00:13:15,406
Ooh!

138
00:13:18,277 --> 00:13:21,041
Pongo!

139
00:13:22,348 --> 00:13:24,782
Turn!

140
00:13:24,851 --> 00:13:26,182
Aaah!

141
00:13:28,054 --> 00:13:31,421
- No, Pongo!
- Aaah!

142
00:13:36,596 --> 00:13:38,928
- Aaah!
- Stop! Stop! Ooh!

143
00:13:51,878 --> 00:13:54,642
Ee-ee-ee-ee-ee!

144
00:13:55,882 --> 00:14:00,012
Ee-ee-ee-ee-ee!

145
00:14:00,119 --> 00:14:03,384
Pongo!

146
00:14:07,627 --> 00:14:10,721
Pongo!

147
00:14:12,298 --> 00:14:14,766
Whoa!

148
00:14:15,601 --> 00:14:17,626
Aaah!

149
00:14:22,041 --> 00:14:25,602
I don't think
he wanted to do that.

150
00:14:25,678 --> 00:14:28,112
There we go, Perdy.

151
00:14:29,649 --> 00:14:32,914
Oh, now stop it. Okay, go!

152
00:14:33,019 --> 00:14:36,682
Go fetch it. Good girl!
Come on, bring it back.

153
00:14:36,789 --> 00:14:39,257
Come here.
Come here.

154
00:14:39,358 --> 00:14:42,327
Yeah, good girl.

155
00:14:42,428 --> 00:14:45,454
Okay. Oh, now, come on,
let's go again.

156
00:14:45,531 --> 00:14:47,465
Pongo!

157
00:14:53,105 --> 00:14:55,039
Pongo!

158
00:14:58,411 --> 00:15:00,845
Go fetch the ball.

159
00:15:00,913 --> 00:15:02,778
Go on.

160
00:15:19,899 --> 00:15:21,867
Hello.
Who are you?

161
00:15:21,934 --> 00:15:24,232
Huh?

162
00:15:30,776 --> 00:15:33,006
Hmm!

163
00:15:40,553 --> 00:15:42,521
Aaah!

164
00:15:42,588 --> 00:15:44,556
I got you.

165
00:15:44,657 --> 00:15:47,125
Very smart.
Very funny.

166
00:15:47,193 --> 00:15:50,629
- Everybody had a good laugh.
- Let go of that dog!

167
00:15:50,696 --> 00:15:54,564
- Stay outta this, lady.
- Stop it, or I'll... I'll hit you!

168
00:15:54,634 --> 00:15:56,761
Today is not a good day
to threaten me, Ma'am.

169
00:15:56,836 --> 00:15:59,828
I don't care if it's a good day
or a bad day, I'll hit you nonetheless!

170
00:15:59,905 --> 00:16:02,567
- Whatever.
- Okay, I gave you
a good and proper warning.

171
00:16:02,642 --> 00:16:04,610
Look, I've had...

172
00:16:04,677 --> 00:16:07,271
Now, release my dog...

173
00:16:07,346 --> 00:16:10,281
or I'll hit you again!

174
00:16:10,349 --> 00:16:12,317
Your dog?

175
00:16:12,385 --> 00:16:14,876
Yes, that is my dog.
Will you let her go?

176
00:16:16,956 --> 00:16:19,584
Excuse me.

177
00:16:23,996 --> 00:16:26,430
- He's a she.
- Mm-hmm.

178
00:16:32,305 --> 00:16:36,298
Hello, Pongo.

179
00:16:38,077 --> 00:16:40,136
I, uh, beg your pardon, Ma'am.

180
00:16:40,212 --> 00:16:42,146
I'm sorry. My mistake.

181
00:16:42,214 --> 00:16:45,775
- What do you got in that
purse of yours? Rocks?
- Oh, no.

182
00:16:45,851 --> 00:16:48,911
Bricks. I've been
paving my garden...

183
00:16:49,021 --> 00:16:51,854
and every time I see a discarded brick,
I just pick it up.

184
00:16:51,924 --> 00:16:54,859
- How many did you find today?
- Uh, three.

185
00:16:54,927 --> 00:16:57,418
- Three? Oh, well,
that's what I would've guessed.
- Hmm.

186
00:16:57,530 --> 00:17:01,933
- Why are you all wet?
- I went swimming in the pond.

187
00:17:02,001 --> 00:17:04,435
- Oh, you shouldn't have.
The water's filthy.
- Mm-hmm.

188
00:17:04,503 --> 00:17:06,494
Yes, and it
tastes like fish.

189
00:17:06,572 --> 00:17:09,439
And, um, you've lost a shoe.
Did you know that?

190
00:17:09,508 --> 00:17:11,442
Yes, I did.
As a matter of fact, I did.

191
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:14,240
- I noticed it running down
the gravelled path.
- Oh, I'm ever so sorry.

192
00:17:14,313 --> 00:17:17,714
I mean, you know,
I thought if you were silly enough
to go swimming in a dirty pond...

193
00:17:17,783 --> 00:17:20,775
you'd be silly enough
not to realize you'd lost a shoe.

194
00:17:20,886 --> 00:17:23,184
Actually, I crashed
my bicycle in the pond.

195
00:17:23,289 --> 00:17:26,725
And the only part of my body
that wasn't injured was my head.

196
00:17:26,792 --> 00:17:29,761
But now, thanks to you, I got
the complete set of bodily injuries.

197
00:17:31,964 --> 00:17:35,525
- Well, it was nice being
assaulted by you, Ms...
- Oh, my name's Anita.

198
00:17:35,601 --> 00:17:37,535
- Anita?
- And yours is Roger.

199
00:17:37,603 --> 00:17:41,539
- Um, I read it on
your dog's identification tag.
- Oh. Oh, yes.

200
00:17:41,607 --> 00:17:45,134
Well, nice meeting you.
I hope I didn't alarm you.

201
00:17:45,211 --> 00:17:47,202
Oh, no, that's fine since...

202
00:17:47,279 --> 00:17:50,442
Well, we both seem to have
a certain fondness for dalmatians.

203
00:17:50,516 --> 00:17:52,711
Yes.

204
00:17:55,821 --> 00:17:57,789
Well, they certainly have...

205
00:17:57,890 --> 00:18:01,724
- A certain fondness
for each other, don't they?
- Yeah.

206
00:18:07,133 --> 00:18:09,328
Well, Pongo...

207
00:18:09,402 --> 00:18:12,337
your roving eye's gotten me
in enough trouble for one day.

208
00:18:12,405 --> 00:18:15,841
Why don't you come with me
and we'll go home?

209
00:18:15,908 --> 00:18:19,036
Um, are you sure you'll be all right?
Perhaps you should call your doctor.

210
00:18:19,111 --> 00:18:21,375
I'll be fine, fine. Just...
Good luck with your bricks.

211
00:18:21,447 --> 00:18:24,848
If you have a concussion,
you shouldn't be left alone, you know.

212
00:18:24,917 --> 00:18:28,580
- Pongo, you could've gotten me killed,
you know that?

213
00:18:28,687 --> 00:18:32,054
You risk losing your master
for a brief frolic with a female?

214
00:18:37,163 --> 00:18:39,097
Come on.

215
00:18:40,633 --> 00:18:44,501
Jolly nice human, don't you think?

216
00:18:47,206 --> 00:18:50,539
Fools aren't born, Pongo. Pretty girls
make them in their spare time.

217
00:18:58,350 --> 00:19:01,751
Shall we?
Come on.

218
00:19:01,854 --> 00:19:05,381
Excuse me.
I'm sorry. Thank you.

219
00:19:05,491 --> 00:19:08,927
§§

220
00:19:28,214 --> 00:19:31,342
You have it all wrong, Pongo. I'm simply
trying to decide on a route home.

221
00:19:31,450 --> 00:19:35,546
It has nothing whatsoever
to do with Anita...
if that's even what her name is.

222
00:19:44,997 --> 00:19:48,091
Perdy!

223
00:19:48,167 --> 00:19:50,294
What is it?
Oh!

224
00:19:51,937 --> 00:19:55,634
Pongo! Pongo!
Easy! Easy! Easy!

225
00:19:55,708 --> 00:19:59,109
Oh! Oh!
Perdy!

226
00:19:59,211 --> 00:20:02,942
Stop! Look out!

227
00:20:03,048 --> 00:20:05,016
Perdy, stop!

228
00:20:05,117 --> 00:20:07,551
Perdy!

229
00:20:08,721 --> 00:20:11,121
- Aaah!
- Look out!

230
00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:13,249
Aaah!

231
00:20:15,694 --> 00:20:18,185
Oh! Ah!

232
00:20:20,332 --> 00:20:23,859
Oh, I've never
been rescued before.

233
00:20:23,936 --> 00:20:27,838
It was very exciting. You were
ever so sweet to give me a kiss.

234
00:20:27,907 --> 00:20:31,104
That wasn't a kiss.
That was mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.

235
00:20:31,176 --> 00:20:33,838
- Oh.
- Besides, it...
it didn't work very well.

236
00:20:33,946 --> 00:20:36,176
You're supposed to lie
flat on your back and remain still.

237
00:20:36,282 --> 00:20:39,649
I couldn't really do it properly
with your arms around my neck.

238
00:20:39,718 --> 00:20:43,154
- I'm ever so sorry.
- No, no, no, that's quite all right.

239
00:20:43,255 --> 00:20:46,884
Ahhh. Well, you give
a very good rescue.

240
00:20:46,959 --> 00:20:49,018
Thank you.

241
00:20:52,231 --> 00:20:54,597
Oh.

242
00:20:57,069 --> 00:20:59,003
Hmm.

243
00:21:00,573 --> 00:21:02,939
I think we have a problem.

244
00:21:05,244 --> 00:21:09,010
I think my dog is in love.

245
00:21:09,114 --> 00:21:12,811
I think mine is, too.

246
00:21:12,885 --> 00:21:15,547
Why is that a problem?

247
00:21:15,621 --> 00:21:18,215
They're going to be brokenhearted
when you leave.

248
00:21:19,959 --> 00:21:23,451
Oh, I don't think I could bear to live
with a brokenhearted dalmatian.

249
00:21:23,529 --> 00:21:26,555
Yes, they're miserable
when they're lonely.

250
00:21:26,632 --> 00:21:29,931
- Well, we'd better think of something.
- I agree.

251
00:21:31,236 --> 00:21:33,602
- Do you want another cup of marriage?
- Excuse me?

252
00:21:33,672 --> 00:21:35,902
Tea?
Another cup of tea?

253
00:21:35,975 --> 00:21:38,705
- You said "marriage."
- Uh, marriage?

254
00:21:38,811 --> 00:21:41,336
Yes, that's what you said.
I... I mean, you meant to say "tea"...

255
00:21:41,447 --> 00:21:43,415
but it...
it came out "marriage."

256
00:21:43,515 --> 00:21:45,608
Oh, I'm sorry.
Uh...

257
00:21:45,718 --> 00:21:50,178
Do you want
another cup of... tea?

258
00:21:51,924 --> 00:21:53,949
I do.

259
00:21:56,295 --> 00:21:58,661
You... You do?

260
00:21:59,698 --> 00:22:01,632
I will.

261
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:03,600
You will?

262
00:22:04,503 --> 00:22:07,097
If you ask me.

263
00:22:10,042 --> 00:22:12,533
Would you?

264
00:22:12,645 --> 00:22:14,579
Yes.

265
00:22:30,062 --> 00:22:33,225
For as much
as Roger and Anita...

266
00:22:34,667 --> 00:22:38,467
have consented together
in holy wedlock...

267
00:22:38,537 --> 00:22:42,405
and have witnessed the same
before God and this company...

268
00:22:42,474 --> 00:22:47,036
and thereto have given and pledged
their troth either to other...

269
00:22:47,146 --> 00:22:49,080
and declared the same...

270
00:22:49,148 --> 00:22:52,049
by the giving
and receiving of a ring...

271
00:22:52,117 --> 00:22:54,449
and by joining of hands...

272
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:58,047
I pronounce that they be
man and wife together.

273
00:22:58,123 --> 00:23:00,057
In the name
of the Father...

274
00:23:00,125 --> 00:23:02,923
and of the Son
and of the Holy Ghost.

275
00:23:02,995 --> 00:23:05,156
- Amen.
- Amen.

276
00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:07,858
God the Father,
God the Son...

277
00:23:07,933 --> 00:23:10,231
God the Holy Ghost...

278
00:23:10,302 --> 00:23:13,362
bless, preserve and keep you.

279
00:23:13,439 --> 00:23:16,840
The Lord, mercifully with
his favor, look upon you...

280
00:23:16,909 --> 00:23:20,606
and so fill you with all
spiritual benediction and grace...

281
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:24,849
that ye may so live
together in this life...

282
00:23:24,917 --> 00:23:26,885
and in the world to come.

283
00:23:26,985 --> 00:23:30,079
And may you have
life everlasting.

284
00:23:30,155 --> 00:23:32,749
- Amen.
- Amen.

285
00:24:31,650 --> 00:24:35,814
Right. Now let me tell you a bit about
this bloke Skinner before we meet him.

286
00:24:35,888 --> 00:24:39,289
Now supposedly,
when he was quite young...

287
00:24:39,358 --> 00:24:41,451
this dog tore open
his throat...

288
00:24:41,527 --> 00:24:43,688
and ripped out
his vocal cords...

289
00:24:43,762 --> 00:24:46,196
leaving him brutally scarred
and completely mute.

290
00:24:46,265 --> 00:24:49,063
He cannot talk at all.

291
00:24:49,134 --> 00:24:51,898
Now pay atten...
Look at me. Pay attention.

292
00:24:51,970 --> 00:24:56,031
This is very important. There are
two things you must not do with Skinner.

293
00:24:56,108 --> 00:24:58,042
Right? One:

294
00:24:58,110 --> 00:25:01,739
Do not look at
the horrendous scar on his neck.

295
00:25:01,847 --> 00:25:03,974
Two:
Don't talk to him.

296
00:25:04,082 --> 00:25:08,644
- Understand? Not a word.
- Right.

297
00:25:12,124 --> 00:25:14,058
Aaah!

298
00:25:14,126 --> 00:25:17,220
Look at the size
of that scar!

299
00:25:17,296 --> 00:25:19,958
No bloody wonder
you can't talk, mate!

300
00:25:22,868 --> 00:25:25,632
Excuse me just a minute, would you?

301
00:25:36,982 --> 00:25:40,509
Gol. Bloody gruesome line
of work you're in, Skinner.

302
00:25:42,287 --> 00:25:46,087
The sight of all these deceased
creatures gives me a shrinky winky.

303
00:25:59,538 --> 00:26:02,530
Much obliged, sunshine.

304
00:26:18,090 --> 00:26:20,684
How could she do this to me?

305
00:26:32,437 --> 00:26:35,702
- Morning, Ma'am.
- Sit!

306
00:26:37,242 --> 00:26:39,870
- Tea?
- Uh, please.

307
00:26:39,978 --> 00:26:42,469
Uh, please.

308
00:26:49,554 --> 00:26:51,351
Thank you.

309
00:26:51,423 --> 00:26:53,323
Thank you.

310
00:26:54,393 --> 00:26:56,987
Ooh, oh, what
a beautiful day, Ma'am.

311
00:26:57,062 --> 00:26:59,326
Blue skies,
birds singing...

312
00:26:59,398 --> 00:27:01,958
the laughter of school children
riding on the gentle breeze...

313
00:27:02,034 --> 00:27:04,730
Get on with it,
you imbecile!

314
00:27:07,272 --> 00:27:09,706
Well, I, uh...

315
00:27:09,775 --> 00:27:12,767
I have here a present
from Mr. Skinner.

316
00:27:24,456 --> 00:27:26,424
Oh.

317
00:27:26,491 --> 00:27:28,789
Oh, it's magnificent.

318
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:31,328
Hello, my beauty.

319
00:27:31,396 --> 00:27:35,162
Oh, come, come.
Come with me.

320
00:27:35,233 --> 00:27:38,725
Come with me, my darling.
Let me see you.

321
00:27:40,038 --> 00:27:42,529
Oh!

322
00:27:42,607 --> 00:27:46,566
You were a big, bad boy,
weren't you, darling?

323
00:27:46,678 --> 00:27:48,612
Yes, yes, yes.

324
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:51,615
Siberian tiger suits Madame
very well, indeed.

325
00:27:51,683 --> 00:27:54,174
Mirror, mirror on the wall...

326
00:27:54,286 --> 00:27:56,982
who's the fairest of them all?

327
00:27:57,055 --> 00:27:58,989
You are.

328
00:28:05,564 --> 00:28:08,089
I remember you were
always very good at drawing...

329
00:28:08,166 --> 00:28:10,361
when you were a little girl.

330
00:28:10,435 --> 00:28:13,233
And now to be with you again
as you start a family of your own...

331
00:28:13,305 --> 00:28:15,296
is like
a dream come true.

332
00:28:15,374 --> 00:28:18,104
Oh, Nanny.

333
00:28:18,210 --> 00:28:20,974
I don't think Roger and I are
quite ready to start a family yet.

334
00:28:21,079 --> 00:28:25,516
Oh, that's a shame.
Aw, well, first the puppies.

335
00:28:26,952 --> 00:28:29,420
Then the babies.

336
00:28:29,488 --> 00:28:31,422
Puppies?

337
00:28:40,032 --> 00:28:42,466
If I've done
my job right, Pongo...

338
00:28:42,534 --> 00:28:46,493
when this new villain comes up, you're
gonna run from the room in a panic.

339
00:29:00,252 --> 00:29:02,618
§§

340
00:29:02,687 --> 00:29:06,714
§§

341
00:29:06,792 --> 00:29:08,692
Got ya!
Arrgh!

342
00:29:14,332 --> 00:29:16,800
It's unmistakable, dear.

343
00:29:16,868 --> 00:29:21,202
It's the look every woman gets when she
knows she's going to be a mother.

344
00:29:21,273 --> 00:29:24,436
Notice how tranquil she is.

345
00:29:24,509 --> 00:29:28,673
Her eyes are soft and warm.

346
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:31,248
Though you might not see it...

347
00:29:31,349 --> 00:29:35,513
you can certainly feel
that she's smiling.

348
00:29:35,587 --> 00:29:38,021
It's the smile we wear...

349
00:29:38,090 --> 00:29:40,524
when we're guarding
a precious secret.

350
00:29:40,592 --> 00:29:44,221
And now that she's living
for others as well as herself...

351
00:29:44,296 --> 00:29:47,163
she's eating more.

352
00:29:47,232 --> 00:29:49,598
And every now and again...

353
00:29:49,668 --> 00:29:54,571
for no reason other than she's so happy
with herself, she sighs.

354
00:29:57,809 --> 00:30:01,074
I think you're right, Nanny.

355
00:30:01,179 --> 00:30:03,340
I think she does
look different.

356
00:30:03,448 --> 00:30:07,885
- Oh, my goodness.
- What is it, Nanny?

357
00:30:10,322 --> 00:30:13,450
Anita...

358
00:30:13,525 --> 00:30:16,289
I think you're going
to have a puppy.

359
00:30:16,361 --> 00:30:18,261
Uh... Oh!

360
00:30:32,944 --> 00:30:34,912
Thank you so much.

361
00:30:35,013 --> 00:30:37,607
- A month's time for a checkup, please?
- All right.

362
00:30:37,716 --> 00:30:39,877
See you again soon,
all right?

363
00:30:40,952 --> 00:30:43,853
Mmm!

364
00:30:45,657 --> 00:30:47,318
So?

365
00:30:47,392 --> 00:30:50,691
Well, he said it's all great,
um, the baby's nice and big...

366
00:30:50,762 --> 00:30:52,923
- It's the right size.
- That's wonderful!

367
00:31:01,506 --> 00:31:04,475
- Oh, no.
- What?

368
00:31:14,586 --> 00:31:16,144
Cruella!

369
00:31:16,221 --> 00:31:18,451
Anita, darling!

370
00:31:20,225 --> 00:31:23,922
Oh, Anita.

371
00:31:23,995 --> 00:31:26,293
Those dazzling dogs!

372
00:31:27,866 --> 00:31:29,800
And you must be Rufus.

373
00:31:29,868 --> 00:31:32,769
No, it's... it's Roger.
And it's a pleasure, Miss De Vil.

374
00:31:32,837 --> 00:31:35,670
- What's a pleasure?
- Uh, making your acquaintance.

375
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:39,335
Such a sweet thought.
I wish I could reciprocate.

376
00:31:39,444 --> 00:31:42,675
Tell me, darling,
you married him for his dog.

377
00:31:45,250 --> 00:31:48,219
Oh, darling,
I've missed you so.

378
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,311
I hate that
you've taken leave.

379
00:31:50,388 --> 00:31:53,186
But I'm still working.
Um, you've been getting my sketches?

380
00:31:53,258 --> 00:31:56,193
Well, it's not the same thing.
I miss the interaction...

381
00:32:00,332 --> 00:32:03,199
And what is it that you do...

382
00:32:03,268 --> 00:32:07,295
that allows you to support Anita
in such... splendor?

383
00:32:07,372 --> 00:32:11,433
- I design video games.
- Video games?

384
00:32:11,509 --> 00:32:13,875
- Mm-hmm.
- Is he having me on?

385
00:32:13,979 --> 00:32:17,540
Oh, no, he's very good at it.
Um, and it's a growing business.

386
00:32:17,649 --> 00:32:20,083
Those horrible noisy things that
children play with on their televisions?

387
00:32:20,151 --> 00:32:24,087
Someone designs them? What a senseless
thing to do with your life.

388
00:32:25,790 --> 00:32:29,089
Oh, did Anita
tell you the news?

389
00:32:30,228 --> 00:32:32,423
She's going to have a baby.

390
00:32:34,132 --> 00:32:36,066
Is this true?

391
00:32:36,134 --> 00:32:38,329
Yes.

392
00:32:38,403 --> 00:32:41,372
Oh, you poor thing!
I'm so sorry.

393
00:32:41,439 --> 00:32:43,737
We're very excited
about it, Cruella.

394
00:32:43,808 --> 00:32:46,242
- You can't be serious.
- She is!

395
00:32:47,479 --> 00:32:51,245
Well, what can I say?
Accidents will happen.

396
00:32:51,316 --> 00:32:54,808
- We're having puppies, too!
- Puppies!

397
00:32:54,919 --> 00:32:57,945
You have been a busy boy.

398
00:32:58,023 --> 00:33:02,619
Well, I must say, that's somewhat
better news. I adore puppies!

399
00:33:02,694 --> 00:33:07,063
- I'll expect a decline
in your work product.
- Oh, I shouldn't think so.

400
00:33:07,132 --> 00:33:10,260
Be sure to let me know
when the blessed event occurs.

401
00:33:10,335 --> 00:33:12,599
Oh, well, it won't be
for another eight months.

402
00:33:12,671 --> 00:33:15,731
The puppies, darling.

403
00:33:15,807 --> 00:33:18,275
Ooh.

404
00:33:19,477 --> 00:33:23,004
I've no use for babies.

405
00:33:24,816 --> 00:33:26,784
Cheerio!
Cheerio, darling!

406
00:33:44,102 --> 00:33:46,195
If I'm this nervous
about your puppies...

407
00:33:46,271 --> 00:33:48,296
what am I gonna be like
when my baby arrives?

408
00:33:59,951 --> 00:34:02,442
How can you be so calm?

409
00:34:05,657 --> 00:34:07,591
Nanny!

410
00:34:10,095 --> 00:34:13,587
Oh, my goodness!
Oh! Oh!

411
00:34:13,698 --> 00:34:15,893
Gangway!

412
00:34:15,967 --> 00:34:18,629
Is it time?
Is there something I can do?

413
00:34:18,703 --> 00:34:20,728
Maybe... Maybe I can be
of some help!

414
00:34:29,981 --> 00:34:32,711
All right, get out,
peek in through the window...

415
00:34:32,784 --> 00:34:35,810
and see if those puppies
have come yet.

416
00:34:35,887 --> 00:34:37,855
Can I borrow your umbrella?

417
00:34:43,161 --> 00:34:45,959
Be careful
when you open it.

418
00:34:46,030 --> 00:34:49,329
They're here!
The puppies are here!

419
00:34:49,401 --> 00:34:52,336
You're a father, Pongo!

420
00:34:52,404 --> 00:34:55,168
- Two!
- Two!

421
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:57,504
You're a father twice!

422
00:34:57,575 --> 00:35:00,135
Make that three!

423
00:35:00,211 --> 00:35:02,406
Three! Three, Pongo!

424
00:35:04,482 --> 00:35:07,713
- Oh, my goodness! Four!
- Four!

425
00:35:32,043 --> 00:35:35,444
Fifteen.

426
00:35:38,416 --> 00:35:41,715
Did you hear that, boy?
Fifteen puppies!

427
00:35:44,756 --> 00:35:47,418
Fourteen.

428
00:35:47,525 --> 00:35:50,961
We lost one.

429
00:36:27,966 --> 00:36:30,833
I'm sorry, Pongo.
I'm so sorry.

430
00:36:43,381 --> 00:36:45,872
I wonder.

431
00:37:33,398 --> 00:37:37,459
Fifteen!
We have 15 puppies!

432
00:37:40,071 --> 00:37:41,936
Look. Oh!

433
00:37:42,006 --> 00:37:45,965
Goodness gracious!
It's a miracle!

434
00:37:46,044 --> 00:37:48,535
Anita, 15!

435
00:37:48,613 --> 00:37:51,081
Fifteen again!
Oh!

436
00:37:51,149 --> 00:37:53,549
We must call
this one "Lucky."

437
00:37:55,620 --> 00:37:58,054
Look!
Look at him.

438
00:37:58,156 --> 00:38:00,090
Oh. Mmm.

439
00:38:00,158 --> 00:38:02,092
- How's Perdy?
- She's tired.

440
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:05,027
Oh, bringing 15 puppies into the world,
I guess she's got a right.

441
00:38:05,096 --> 00:38:08,224
Yeah. But they're
so beautiful.

442
00:38:08,299 --> 00:38:11,325
You can
go in now, Pongo.

443
00:38:13,671 --> 00:38:17,505
Here we are, Perdy.
Yes, it's Lucky.

444
00:38:17,575 --> 00:38:20,203
Now make room, you others.

445
00:38:20,278 --> 00:38:24,408
Well done, Perdy.
There's a good girl.

446
00:38:26,484 --> 00:38:29,715
I'll leave you two alone.

447
00:38:43,034 --> 00:38:45,366
I'm glad I'm only
having the one.

448
00:38:45,436 --> 00:38:47,836
Hmm.

449
00:39:04,455 --> 00:39:07,049
Anita?

450
00:39:07,158 --> 00:39:09,285
Anita?
There you are!

451
00:39:09,394 --> 00:39:13,160
Where are the puppies?
They should have arrived by now.

452
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:18,635
How marvelous.

453
00:39:18,703 --> 00:39:21,001
How marvelous!

454
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:23,974
How perfect...

455
00:39:24,042 --> 00:39:27,910
- Oh, the devil take it!
They're mongrels!

456
00:39:27,979 --> 00:39:30,743
No spots!
No spots at all!

457
00:39:30,815 --> 00:39:33,477
What horrible little white rats!

458
00:39:33,551 --> 00:39:36,145
Oh, but their spots
don't come 'til later.

459
00:39:36,220 --> 00:39:38,654
- You're sure?
- Yes.

460
00:39:38,723 --> 00:39:43,183
All right, put them in a bag.
I'll take them with me now.

461
00:39:43,261 --> 00:39:46,492
- What? They were just born!
- I can see that!

462
00:39:46,564 --> 00:39:49,328
But, Cruella, the puppies have to be
with their mother for several weeks.

463
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:52,233
- They're not ready to leave.
- Fine, put the little brutes
on reserve for me.

464
00:39:52,303 --> 00:39:54,931
- How much would you like?
- They're not for sale.

465
00:39:55,006 --> 00:39:58,806
Oh? You've come into
some money, have you?

466
00:39:58,876 --> 00:40:00,935
Did you design some silly game...

467
00:40:01,012 --> 00:40:03,173
that will drive the delinquent kiddies
into frenzies of video delight?

468
00:40:03,247 --> 00:40:05,681
- As a matter of fact, I have...
- No, no, what Roger means to say...

469
00:40:05,750 --> 00:40:08,776
- Is that we're not sure
we're going to sell the puppies.
- Anita, don't be ridiculous!

470
00:40:08,853 --> 00:40:11,754
- You can't possibly afford
to keep them.

471
00:40:11,823 --> 00:40:13,814
I'll pay you twice
what they're worth.

472
00:40:13,925 --> 00:40:16,621
Come now, I'm being
more than generous. Ј500!

473
00:40:16,728 --> 00:40:20,960
- Oh!
- Ј7,500!

474
00:40:21,032 --> 00:40:23,830
Fair? Ј2 per spot.

475
00:40:23,901 --> 00:40:26,631
But, Cruella,
what would you do with 15 puppies?

476
00:40:26,704 --> 00:40:29,696
But that's irrelevant, Anita. She can't
have any because they're not for sale!

477
00:40:29,774 --> 00:40:31,969
I'm getting very
tired of you, Roland!

478
00:40:32,043 --> 00:40:34,876
- Roger!
- Whatever. Take it.

479
00:40:41,986 --> 00:40:43,920
Take it.

480
00:40:46,390 --> 00:40:48,654
Take it!

481
00:40:53,664 --> 00:40:56,064
Cruella...

482
00:40:56,134 --> 00:40:59,365
the puppies are not for sale.

483
00:41:01,405 --> 00:41:04,431
You're quite... sure?

484
00:41:04,509 --> 00:41:06,238
- Yes.
- Yes.

485
00:41:08,946 --> 00:41:12,882
All right, keep the little beasts.

486
00:41:12,984 --> 00:41:16,613
Do what you like with them.
Drown them, for all I care!

487
00:41:16,721 --> 00:41:19,519
You're a fool, Anita!
I've no use for fools.

488
00:41:19,590 --> 00:41:21,615
You're fired!
You're finished!

489
00:41:21,726 --> 00:41:24,661
You'll never work in fashion again!
I'm through with all of you!

490
00:41:24,729 --> 00:41:27,095
I'll get even!
Just wait!

491
00:41:27,165 --> 00:41:31,067
You'll be sorry, you fools!
You idiots!

492
00:41:37,074 --> 00:41:40,373

515
00:43:13,738 --> 00:43:17,003
That a boy.
Oh, yeah.

516
00:43:17,074 --> 00:43:19,065
Oh, yeah.

517
00:43:19,143 --> 00:43:22,078
Yeah, yeah, I know.
Mm-hmm.

518
00:43:22,146 --> 00:43:24,808
Fidget?

519
00:43:24,882 --> 00:43:28,340
Here.

520
00:43:31,789 --> 00:43:34,451
§ Tiny tots
with their eyes all aglow §

521
00:43:36,594 --> 00:43:39,722
Two-tone?

522
00:43:43,534 --> 00:43:46,970
- I know. No, I know.
You all like to do it.

523
00:43:48,940 --> 00:43:51,875
Come on, there we go,
there we go, there we go.

524
00:44:01,585 --> 00:44:03,519
- Wizzer.
- Wizzer.

525
00:44:36,153 --> 00:44:38,417
Right, we're on.

526
00:44:44,595 --> 00:44:46,529
Get...

527
00:44:48,332 --> 00:44:50,425
Get your own!

528
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:05,981
Somebody didn't
finish their supper.

529
00:45:07,618 --> 00:45:09,711
We're on a budget.

530
00:45:09,820 --> 00:45:12,880
"Waste not, want not,"
that's my motto.

531
00:45:17,294 --> 00:45:19,228
Who on earth?

532
00:45:23,501 --> 00:45:25,628
Coming.
Coming!

533
00:45:25,703 --> 00:45:27,637
Coming.

534
00:45:29,373 --> 00:45:31,967
- Good evening, Madame.
- Oh, my goodness!

535
00:45:32,043 --> 00:45:35,638
- It's all right, lady.
We're professionals.

536
00:45:35,713 --> 00:45:37,704
Aaah!

537
00:45:37,782 --> 00:45:39,943
Come here!

538
00:45:40,051 --> 00:45:43,452
- Get her off!
- Time to go now!

539
00:45:43,521 --> 00:45:47,423
- Let go of me!
- Straight ahead. Straight ahead.

540
00:45:47,491 --> 00:45:50,324
- Police, help! Police, help!
- Push! Push!

541
00:45:54,331 --> 00:45:57,630
- Get in there!
- Fingers!

542
00:45:57,701 --> 00:46:00,795
Let me out of here!
Let me out!

543
00:46:00,871 --> 00:46:02,930
- Open the door!
- Oh, do shut up!

544
00:46:03,007 --> 00:46:05,441
Open the door!
Police!

545
00:46:05,509 --> 00:46:07,807
Police! I'll see you
go to prison for this...

546
00:46:07,878 --> 00:46:09,846
if it's the last thing I do.

547
00:46:09,914 --> 00:46:11,882
There.

548
00:46:11,949 --> 00:46:14,713
Well, the old bird
put up a good fight.

549
00:46:14,819 --> 00:46:17,185
I like a bit of spirit in the woman.

550
00:46:17,254 --> 00:46:20,246
That's all right for you to say.
You didn't get smashed in the face.

551
00:46:20,357 --> 00:46:23,087
Shh, shh, shh.

552
00:46:26,497 --> 00:46:29,796
Aw!
Give me the bag.

553
00:46:29,867 --> 00:46:32,358
Come on, come on.

554
00:46:32,436 --> 00:46:35,462
Here.

555
00:46:46,517 --> 00:46:49,452
All right, come here, you...

556
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:53,957
Spotty little... dog!

557
00:47:07,004 --> 00:47:09,336
Evening, General.

558
00:47:09,406 --> 00:47:12,898
Montgomery! Heel, boy!

559
00:47:12,977 --> 00:47:15,810
Heel, boy! Heel!

560
00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:18,576
- Jasper...
- Stop it now!

561
00:47:18,649 --> 00:47:21,846
- Do you know what I think?
- What's that?

562
00:47:21,952 --> 00:47:24,716
I think that bulldog
knows what we just done.

563
00:47:24,788 --> 00:47:27,689
Nah, it's a dog, Horace.

564
00:47:27,758 --> 00:47:29,851
Dog's ain't got the brains
to figure things out.

565
00:47:29,927 --> 00:47:31,861
Come on. At ease!

566
00:47:31,929 --> 00:47:33,863
Luckily.

567
00:47:42,606 --> 00:47:45,769
Come on home, Montgomery!

568
00:48:06,096 --> 00:48:08,690
- I mean, I think... Pongo!
- Perdy!

569
00:48:10,701 --> 00:48:14,068
Help! Police!

570
00:48:14,138 --> 00:48:16,402
Where are they?

571
00:48:19,043 --> 00:48:21,443
Oh, no!
They've taken the puppies.

572
00:48:21,512 --> 00:48:24,481
Anita! Roger!

573
00:48:24,548 --> 00:48:26,914
Thank God they're home!

574
00:48:37,561 --> 00:48:39,426
Oh, thank goodness
you've come.

575
00:48:39,496 --> 00:48:42,226
- Why? What is it?
- The puppies.

576
00:48:42,299 --> 00:48:46,099
Two men, they've stolen the puppies.
I tried to stop them.

577
00:48:46,170 --> 00:48:48,365
They locked me in the cupboard.

578
00:48:48,439 --> 00:48:50,964
I shouted and shouted,
but nobody came.

579
00:49:43,327 --> 00:49:45,318
Ah, good evening, Madame.

580
00:49:45,396 --> 00:49:49,298
I sincerely hope
I've not disturbed your relaxation...

581
00:49:49,366 --> 00:49:52,301
- But I have some good news.
- Did you get the puppies?

582
00:49:52,369 --> 00:49:54,803
Affirmative.

583
00:49:54,872 --> 00:49:56,806
All of them?

584
00:49:56,874 --> 00:49:59,240
Every single one.

585
00:49:59,310 --> 00:50:03,838
My faith in your limited intelligence
is momentarily restored.

586
00:50:03,914 --> 00:50:06,712
Oh! You are
too kind, Madame.

587
00:50:08,986 --> 00:50:11,614
They've got the 15!

588
00:50:11,722 --> 00:50:15,089
Add them to the other puppies
we've already stolen...

589
00:50:15,159 --> 00:50:18,390
and I have my cozy puppy coat.

590
00:50:20,464 --> 00:50:24,423
I'll be wearing Anita's dogs.

591
00:50:53,263 --> 00:50:57,859
Right, well, I'm gonna fill me snoot
and go to bed. I'm dead tired.

592
00:50:59,770 --> 00:51:02,068
I'm hearing dogs again, Jasper.

593
00:51:02,139 --> 00:51:05,438
Oh, shut up in there!

594
00:52:13,343 --> 00:52:17,279
- You keep your chin up.
We'll do our best.
- Thank you, Inspector.

595
00:52:17,347 --> 00:52:19,315
- Good night, Madame.
- Good night.

596
00:52:21,685 --> 00:52:23,653
He was most sympathetic.

597
00:52:23,754 --> 00:52:26,416
He says they're going
to do the best they can.

598
00:52:26,523 --> 00:52:29,424
For what that's worth.

599
00:52:29,493 --> 00:52:32,826
- Do you think they'll find them?
- How are they going to find
15 little puppies...

600
00:52:32,896 --> 00:52:34,830
in a city this size?

601
00:52:34,898 --> 00:52:38,425
If they're even in the city.
What can the police do?

602
00:52:38,502 --> 00:52:40,902
What can we do?
What can anyone do?

603
00:53:16,406 --> 00:53:19,933
Woof! Woof! Woof!

604
00:56:28,265 --> 00:56:30,893
Pongo!

605
00:56:30,967 --> 00:56:33,128
Pongo!

606
00:56:34,304 --> 00:56:36,864
Pongo!

607
00:58:11,768 --> 00:58:15,602
- Did you hear that?
- What?

608
00:58:15,672 --> 00:58:17,606
That noise.

609
00:58:17,674 --> 00:58:21,041
- What noise?
- That noise I just heard.

610
00:58:21,111 --> 00:58:24,638
- Did you hear it?
- Oh, yeah.

611
00:58:24,748 --> 00:58:29,981
Yeah. It sounded just like a complete
berk asking me irritating questions.

612
00:58:31,121 --> 00:58:33,419
Oh, good, it's stopped now.

613
00:59:13,730 --> 00:59:15,994
I'll be honest
with you, mate.

614
00:59:16,066 --> 00:59:18,557
This job is fast
losing its charm.

615
00:59:18,635 --> 00:59:22,571
The housing stinks;
the food's lousy...

616
00:59:22,639 --> 00:59:24,903
the lavatory facilities are appalling...

617
00:59:24,975 --> 00:59:28,172
and so far, we haven't been paid
so much as one quid.

618
00:59:28,245 --> 00:59:30,543
Oh, will you stop moaning!

619
00:59:30,647 --> 00:59:32,877
Look, this time tomorrow night,
it's all over.

620
00:59:32,983 --> 00:59:36,544
We get our boodle, we'll be out of here
before you can say, "Dead puppies."

621
00:59:36,653 --> 00:59:40,282
Now, go to sleep.

622
00:59:59,976 --> 01:00:02,137
Hmm?

623
01:00:59,002 --> 01:01:01,630
Mm! Mm.

624
01:01:21,224 --> 01:01:24,751
Mr. Skinner, suspicions are mounting.

625
01:01:24,828 --> 01:01:26,819
Police are everywhere.

626
01:01:26,896 --> 01:01:29,831
I want the job done tonight.
Can you do it?

627
01:01:34,404 --> 01:01:37,237
Any way you want.
Poison them. Drown them.

628
01:01:37,307 --> 01:01:39,798
Bash them on the head!
Got any chloroform?

629
01:01:39,876 --> 01:01:43,368
I don't care how you kill the little
beasts. Just do it and do it now!

630
01:02:12,208 --> 01:02:14,904
Pongo and Perdy
will turn up, won't they?

631
01:02:14,978 --> 01:02:18,038
If you ask me, they will. I think
they just went looking for the puppies.

632
01:02:18,148 --> 01:02:20,207
You know who did this,
don't you?

633
01:02:20,316 --> 01:02:22,944
I, for one, wouldn't be
the least bit surprised.

634
01:02:23,053 --> 01:02:26,181
She has a horrible temper on her.

635
01:02:26,256 --> 01:02:28,850
The dogs never cared for her.

636
01:02:28,925 --> 01:02:31,723
Dogs have a sixth sense
about things like that.

637
01:02:31,795 --> 01:02:34,423
They can smell ill intentions.

638
01:02:34,497 --> 01:02:36,465
Roger.

639
01:02:36,533 --> 01:02:40,663
- What? What's wrong?
- Nanny, what did
I do with my portfolio?

640
01:02:40,737 --> 01:02:42,932
It's in the nursery closet, dear.

641
01:02:43,006 --> 01:02:44,997
Anita?

642
01:02:59,923 --> 01:03:03,086
She did steal the puppies,
and this is why.

643
01:03:07,497 --> 01:03:10,660
She's going to
kill the puppies.

644
01:04:02,852 --> 01:04:04,786
Hmm?

645
01:04:58,608 --> 01:05:03,409
Right, that's it. Time to let
the little yappers have it.

646
01:05:03,479 --> 01:05:06,209
We ain't supposed to do it.
That's Skinner's job.

647
01:05:06,282 --> 01:05:08,682
Well, Skinner isn't here, is he?

648
01:05:08,751 --> 01:05:12,482
Besides, I don't see why that
little runt should have all the fun.

649
01:05:14,824 --> 01:05:17,224
How'd you wanna do it?

650
01:05:17,293 --> 01:05:21,229
Well, personally,
I think I favor the fire iron.

651
01:05:35,545 --> 01:05:38,446
Why, that...
that'll be Miss De Vil.

652
01:05:38,514 --> 01:05:42,245
Uh... fix your shirt
and tart up your hair.

653
01:05:50,126 --> 01:05:52,094
Good eve... ning.

654
01:05:59,802 --> 01:06:01,793
Hello?

655
01:06:01,871 --> 01:06:04,431
Anybody there?

656
01:06:40,410 --> 01:06:43,174
Mm-hmm.

657
01:07:16,479 --> 01:07:19,744
Maybe we was hearing things.

658
01:07:37,767 --> 01:07:39,758
Oi!

659
01:07:41,604 --> 01:07:44,038
- Get out of my truck!
- Yeah!

660
01:08:07,330 --> 01:08:10,265
Go on! Get outta here!

661
01:08:11,634 --> 01:08:13,693
Yeah!

662
01:08:13,770 --> 01:08:17,228
There's plenty more where that came
from, should you elect to come back.

663
01:08:41,664 --> 01:08:43,996
I don't believe it.

664
01:09:33,049 --> 01:09:36,348
I don't care what you say.

665
01:09:36,519 --> 01:09:39,044
We bloody well
better be careful.

666
01:09:39,155 --> 01:09:41,521
Yeah, that's right.
What we better be careful of...

667
01:09:41,591 --> 01:09:45,960
is the huge, thundering macroeconomic
bulk of your stupidity.

668
01:09:46,028 --> 01:09:48,394
I ain't takin'
any more lip from you, mate.

669
01:09:48,464 --> 01:09:53,060
Oh, forget about that. We have got
99 stinking puppies to find and kill.

670
01:09:53,135 --> 01:09:55,126
Now get on with it!

671
01:10:10,987 --> 01:10:14,115
Here, puppies.

672
01:10:14,223 --> 01:10:16,487
Here, puppies.

673
01:10:18,327 --> 01:10:21,455
Pup, pup, pup, pup, puppies.

674
01:10:33,009 --> 01:10:37,810
Come here,
you speckled lap rat.

675
01:11:00,136 --> 01:11:02,070
Eh!

676
01:11:42,445 --> 01:11:45,039
Stay.

677
01:11:56,792 --> 01:12:00,489
You bug...

678
01:12:00,563 --> 01:12:03,054
You come here!
I'm gonna get you, you little...

679
01:12:24,120 --> 01:12:26,850
Cold.

680
01:12:26,956 --> 01:12:29,254
Cold. Ah.

681
01:13:30,720 --> 01:13:33,382
Good evening, madame.

682
01:13:33,489 --> 01:13:35,218
Good evening.
Hello.

683
01:13:35,291 --> 01:13:37,418
What are you doing
up there?

684
01:13:37,493 --> 01:13:41,429
I'm... I was... I was just
fetching the puppies, ma'am.

685
01:13:41,497 --> 01:13:46,093
And where... are...
the puppies?

686
01:13:46,168 --> 01:13:48,693
Oh! There.
You see, once again...

687
01:13:48,771 --> 01:13:53,708
Madame has, like a laser, gone straight
to the heart of the issue.

688
01:13:53,776 --> 01:13:56,745
It's a quality
I've always admired in her.

689
01:13:56,812 --> 01:13:59,940
"Where are the puppies?
Where are the puppies?" Brilliant.

690
01:14:00,015 --> 01:14:02,449
Let me just say right now...

691
01:14:02,518 --> 01:14:05,976
that I'm not...
absolutely a hundred percent certain...

692
01:14:06,055 --> 01:14:08,046
where the puppies are.

693
01:14:08,157 --> 01:14:12,184
But if you'll just give me a second,
I'll check with my associate.

694
01:14:12,261 --> 01:14:14,627
Uh, Horace?

695
01:14:14,697 --> 01:14:19,430
Get down from there
and catch those puppies!

696
01:14:22,037 --> 01:14:25,131
Hopelessly stupid, pathetic fools.

697
01:14:25,207 --> 01:14:28,267
I'll find the bloody mongrels myself.

698
01:14:39,622 --> 01:14:43,456
- You just had to let
those puppies get away, didn't you?

699
01:14:43,526 --> 01:14:47,587
- Never paying attention.
- Well, where was you?

700
01:14:47,663 --> 01:14:50,188
Where wa... I was not
splashing about in the pond!

701
01:14:50,266 --> 01:14:52,666
You've infuriated the old bag.

702
01:14:52,735 --> 01:14:55,465
And if we don't get those puppies back,
then it's quite literally our heads!

703
01:14:55,538 --> 01:14:58,632
Oh, come on!

704
01:14:58,707 --> 01:15:02,302
- Right. You better get out
and check the tailpipe.

705
01:15:02,378 --> 01:15:04,903
We've got a condensation problem.

706
01:15:04,980 --> 01:15:06,971
One of these days...

707
01:15:07,049 --> 01:15:10,917
I'm gonna be full-up of you.

708
01:15:11,020 --> 01:15:13,215
Aah!

709
01:15:23,365 --> 01:15:25,356
Ooh.

710
01:15:29,438 --> 01:15:31,668
Oh, do come on!

711
01:15:31,740 --> 01:15:35,437
There! You see?

712
01:15:36,545 --> 01:15:39,241
Hmm?

713
01:18:00,589 --> 01:18:03,080
Turn the heater on, will ya?

714
01:18:03,192 --> 01:18:06,161
No. Not with this thing
acting the way she is.

715
01:18:06,228 --> 01:18:10,096
I don't want to risk losing power.

716
01:18:10,165 --> 01:18:14,124
I can't stand
the cold no more.

717
01:18:14,203 --> 01:18:16,171
I want heat!

718
01:18:17,573 --> 01:18:20,337
- Oh! No!
- Fire!

719
01:18:20,409 --> 01:18:22,570
Too hot! Too hot!

720
01:18:22,644 --> 01:18:24,737
Aah! Too hot!

721
01:18:24,813 --> 01:18:27,213
Oh, no!
Oh, no! Aah!

722
01:18:31,987 --> 01:18:34,649
Suspect apprehended...

723
01:18:37,326 --> 01:18:40,386
Your suspicions were justified.

724
01:18:40,496 --> 01:18:44,432
According to the staff,
Miss De Vil left earlier for
a family property in Suffolk.

725
01:18:44,500 --> 01:18:47,094
I have informed
the local police.

726
01:18:47,169 --> 01:18:50,400
Officers there will be
on the lookout for your puppies...

727
01:18:50,472 --> 01:18:53,100
and Miss De Vil.

728
01:18:53,175 --> 01:18:56,110
I only hope we're not too late.

729
01:21:29,198 --> 01:21:31,462
Oh!

730
01:21:33,769 --> 01:21:36,704
This is extraordinary.

731
01:21:36,772 --> 01:21:39,900
I'm reduced to tramping
through sewage...

732
01:21:39,975 --> 01:21:44,844
because my two imbeciles can't
keep track of a bunch of infant dogs!

733
01:21:56,592 --> 01:21:59,561
Oh!

734
01:22:51,613 --> 01:22:53,706
I do not believe it.

735
01:22:53,782 --> 01:22:56,080
We got no truck, no dogs.
We are so dead.

736
01:22:56,151 --> 01:22:58,984
Number 1 Dead Street, that's us.

737
01:22:59,054 --> 01:23:01,989
Look! Tracks.

738
01:23:07,629 --> 01:23:10,427
I love you.

739
01:23:10,499 --> 01:23:12,558
There you are. You see?

740
01:23:12,634 --> 01:23:17,128
If dogs are so smart,
they wouldn't leave tracks
for wary predators such as us.

741
01:23:17,205 --> 01:23:21,141
- Yeah.
- Now, I've always said that
human beings are essentially superior...

742
01:23:21,209 --> 01:23:25,873
you know, blessed with
faculties of speech and thought
and a couple of other things.

743
01:23:55,077 --> 01:23:57,375
Uh!

744
01:24:00,882 --> 01:24:03,476
Don't worry, I won't ruin
your little puppy coat.

745
01:24:03,552 --> 01:24:06,783
I'm just going to
make a few buttonholes.
Where are you, you filthy beast?

746
01:24:14,296 --> 01:24:16,423
Ah.

747
01:24:22,037 --> 01:24:24,130
Oh, yes.

748
01:24:24,206 --> 01:24:29,769
I love the smell
of near extinction.

749
01:24:42,424 --> 01:24:44,551
Got it!

750
01:25:03,445 --> 01:25:06,005
Oh! Oh-oh! Oh! Oh!

751
01:25:11,186 --> 01:25:14,485
Stupidity, you see? That's your problem.
That's what's been holding you back.

752
01:25:14,556 --> 01:25:17,024
If it was up to you,
you'd have taken hold of that wire...

753
01:25:17,092 --> 01:25:20,152
set fire to your undershorts,
cooked your tongue...

754
01:25:20,228 --> 01:25:23,322
before even thinking
it was electrified.

755
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:27,161
Point taken.

756
01:25:27,269 --> 01:25:29,499
But what are the logs for?

757
01:25:29,571 --> 01:25:32,665
"What are the..."
You see, the...

758
01:25:32,741 --> 01:25:36,507
We stand upon the logs
and hop over...

759
01:25:36,578 --> 01:25:39,672
thereby avoiding painful electric shock.

760
01:25:41,716 --> 01:25:43,684
Brilliant.

761
01:25:43,752 --> 01:25:47,483
Right. Mount the log.

762
01:25:51,493 --> 01:25:53,518
Extend leg.

763
01:25:57,566 --> 01:26:00,899
All right.
Now, when I count to three, we jump.

764
01:26:00,969 --> 01:26:03,597
- Ready?
- Yes.

765
01:26:03,672 --> 01:26:05,503
One.

766
01:26:36,638 --> 01:26:38,936
Aah!

767
01:26:40,041 --> 01:26:42,305
Useless, disgusting creatures.

768
01:26:42,377 --> 01:26:45,312
I'm sick to think
we breathe the same air.

769
01:26:57,926 --> 01:27:01,225
Bingo!

770
01:27:01,329 --> 01:27:03,388
Poor little things.

771
01:27:03,498 --> 01:27:06,763
I'm gonna cut you off...

772
01:27:06,835 --> 01:27:10,430
then cut you up.

773
01:27:14,809 --> 01:27:17,243
Darling, red isn't your color.

774
01:27:17,312 --> 01:27:20,975
Give me the hat.

775
01:27:21,049 --> 01:27:23,381
Give me the hat...

776
01:27:23,451 --> 01:27:26,147
Or you'll become a hat.

777
01:27:26,221 --> 01:27:28,951
Give it to me!

778
01:28:10,732 --> 01:28:12,700
Oh!

779
01:28:32,087 --> 01:28:35,181
Thank the Lord.

780
01:28:35,256 --> 01:28:37,247
We're saved.

781
01:28:37,325 --> 01:28:39,486
- Here you go.
- Up you go.

782
01:28:39,561 --> 01:28:41,529
- Much obliged. Thanks.
- Watch your heads.

783
01:28:41,596 --> 01:28:43,826
- Very kind.
- Thank you.

784
01:28:43,932 --> 01:28:46,628
Nice and quiet.

785
01:28:49,571 --> 01:28:52,335
- This is lovely. Yeah.
- Isn't it?

786
01:28:52,407 --> 01:28:54,898
Nice and warm.

787
01:28:54,976 --> 01:28:57,308
No animals neither.

788
01:29:21,736 --> 01:29:24,728
You... beasts!

789
01:29:24,839 --> 01:29:28,570
But I'm not beaten yet.

790
01:29:28,643 --> 01:29:32,079
You've won the battle,
but I'm about to win the wardrobe.

791
01:29:32,147 --> 01:29:35,742
My spotty puppy coat is
in plain sight and leaving tracks.

792
01:29:35,817 --> 01:29:40,618
In a moment I'll have what
I came for, while all of you
will end up as sausage meat...

793
01:29:40,689 --> 01:29:43,624
alone on some sad plastic plate...

794
01:29:43,692 --> 01:29:47,788
dead and medium red;
no friends, no family, no pulse...

795
01:29:47,862 --> 01:29:51,423
just slapped between two buns,
smothered in onions...

796
01:29:51,533 --> 01:29:53,626
with fries on the side.

797
01:29:53,735 --> 01:29:58,502
- Cruella De Vil has
the last laugh!

798
01:30:36,344 --> 01:30:38,403
Miss De Vil?

799
01:30:38,480 --> 01:30:42,007
- Yes?
- We have a warrant for your arrest.

800
01:30:42,083 --> 01:30:46,383
Oh? Is there
something wrong?

801
01:31:03,338 --> 01:31:06,398
Stop. What's that up ahead?

802
01:31:15,617 --> 01:31:18,415
Well, will you look at that.

803
01:31:50,051 --> 01:31:53,145
Excuse me, madame.
Would you mind standing back?

804
01:31:57,592 --> 01:32:01,187
I've come up with 98 pups.
The two adults make it 100 even.

805
01:32:01,262 --> 01:32:03,321
We've got 100 here, sir.

806
01:32:19,881 --> 01:32:22,111
Uh, make that...

807
01:32:22,183 --> 01:32:26,051
101 dalmatians, sir.

808
01:32:44,072 --> 01:32:46,040
Congratulations.

809
01:32:46,140 --> 01:32:49,041
You've just won
gold, silver and bronze...

810
01:32:49,110 --> 01:32:51,670
in the Morons Olympics.

811
01:33:00,255 --> 01:33:02,450
- Who won the gold?
- Shut up!

812
01:33:04,425 --> 01:33:07,792
My business,
my reputation, my life...

813
01:33:07,862 --> 01:33:11,025
has been ruined
because you three incompetent twits...

814
01:33:11,099 --> 01:33:14,227
let yourselves be outsmarted
by a bunch of dumb animals!

815
01:33:14,302 --> 01:33:17,294
And you call
yourselves men. Ha!

816
01:33:17,372 --> 01:33:20,830
I've seen more intelligent
pieces of carpet!

817
01:33:45,199 --> 01:33:48,032
Oh, they're here!
Anita!

818
01:33:48,102 --> 01:33:50,434
Roger!

819
01:33:55,276 --> 01:33:58,473
- The puppies!
- Here... Oh, my goodness! Look at them.

820
01:33:58,579 --> 01:34:01,343
- Oh!
- Oh, Pongo!

821
01:34:01,416 --> 01:34:03,680
Oh, Perdy!

822
01:34:03,751 --> 01:34:07,187
Oh! That a boy!
That a boy! Yeah!

823
01:34:07,255 --> 01:34:11,214
- That a boy!
- Oh! Oh!

824
01:34:11,292 --> 01:34:15,786
Oh, thank you, Officer!
How can we ever repay you?

825
01:34:15,863 --> 01:34:20,232
Well, your dogs were the only ones
with identification tags.

826
01:34:20,301 --> 01:34:23,031
We have no idea
which puppy goes where.

827
01:34:23,104 --> 01:34:26,198
Our records indicate
that so far...

828
01:34:26,307 --> 01:34:29,765
nobody has called
to claim the other puppies.

829
01:34:29,877 --> 01:34:32,437
Now, they need a home, or...

830
01:34:32,547 --> 01:34:35,641
Well, they go to the pound.

831
01:34:43,191 --> 01:34:45,955
Oh, no. No.
No, no, no, no. Uh... Uh...

832
01:34:46,027 --> 01:34:49,827
- Roger, we can't... We don't have room.
- Well, we'll get a bigger place.

833
01:34:49,897 --> 01:34:53,333
We have 17 as it is.
What's a few more?

834
01:34:53,401 --> 01:34:55,733
We'll work something out.

835
01:35:01,309 --> 01:35:04,437
Oh.

836
01:35:04,545 --> 01:35:07,173
You'll have dozens
of children, you know.

837
01:35:09,984 --> 01:35:12,418
Well, I won't have them
chewing up the carpets...

838
01:35:12,487 --> 01:35:15,012
barking until all hours of the night.

839
01:35:19,727 --> 01:35:23,595
All right.
Everyone inside before we all get cold.

840
01:35:23,664 --> 01:35:26,724
Unload the puppies!

841
01:36:27,762 --> 01:36:30,026
Get ready.
Get ready.

842
01:36:43,411 --> 01:36:47,404
Cool!
Excellent villain, mate.

843
01:36:47,515 --> 01:36:49,608
Thanks, Herbert!

844
01:36:49,684 --> 01:36:51,879
- Congratulations.
- Uh, why, yes. Thank you.

845
01:36:51,953 --> 01:36:54,888
- Thank you. Thank you...
- See you in my office.
We've got terms to sort out.

846
01:36:54,956 --> 01:36:58,187
- Okay. Great.
- Excellent villain, mate.

847
01:36:58,259 --> 01:37:00,784
I don't be...

848
01:37:04,265 --> 01:37:07,928
I can barely believe it.
Our baby is a year old.

849
01:37:08,002 --> 01:37:11,870
- We have a new house, a new life...
- And we have each other.

850
01:37:11,939 --> 01:37:14,032
We have Nanny.

851
01:37:14,142 --> 01:37:17,703
- And I have the three of you.
- We have two wonderful dogs.

852
01:37:17,812 --> 01:37:20,212
And they have their children.

853
01:37:20,281 --> 01:37:22,511
And their stepchildren.

854
01:37:22,583 --> 01:37:24,676
And they have their children.

855
01:37:24,752 --> 01:37:27,016
And their stepchildren
have children.

856
01:37:27,088 --> 01:37:29,818
And their children
have children.

857
01:37:29,891 --> 01:37:33,349
And speaking of children...

858
01:37:33,427 --> 01:37:37,523
Roger, darling,
I've got the most wonderful news.
